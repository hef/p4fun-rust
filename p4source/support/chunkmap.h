/*

A chunk map is a series of size/hash pairs, where the size is a region of
a file at a specific offset, and the hash is the digest of that regions
content.

Chunk map properties:

- Small storage space, to reduce network overhead.
- Should not change often because the format is interpreted by the client
- Maps become incompatible if the CDC chunking chunk size parameters change

Chunk map file format details:

# All data is little-endian.

# Field 0 is the version number of the map format

uint8_t : version

# Fields 1-n are size/hash pairs

# Note that this chunk size wastes a bit of space being a uint32_t
# because the maximum size of a chunk is only going to be about a
# uint24_t.  The size difference isn't a whole lot though.
4 byte unsigned integer (i.e. uint32_t) : chunk size
32 bytes : BLAKE3 hash value

# The final field is a trailing verification checksum
# for the prior content of the map file.

32 bytes : BLAKE3 hash value

Note that the originating file offset for each chunk is not stored,
and must be calculated on access.  Same for the total file size and
hash of the whole file.

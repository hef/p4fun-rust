    Helix Core client usage:

    p4 [options] command [--explain] [arg ...]
    p4 -V

	Many command flags have both short-form and long-form syntax. Specify
	the --explain flag to display additional information about the flags
	accepted by this command. For example, 'p4 sync --explain' to display
	all the options supported by sync, or 'p4 edit --explain -k' to
	display information about the -k flag to edit.

	options:
	    -b batchsize -c client -C charset -d dir -H host
	    -I -G -L language -p port -P pass -q -r retries -s
	    -Q charset -u user -x file -z tag

	The -b batchsize specifies a batch size (number of arguments) to
	use when processing a command from a file '-x' (default 128).

	The -c flag specifies the client name, overriding the value of
	$P4CLIENT in the environment and the default (the hostname).

	The -C flag specifies the client's character set, overriding the
	value of $P4CHARSET in the environment.  See 'p4 help charset'
	for more information.

	The -d flag specifies the current directory, overriding the value of
	$PWD in the environment and the default (the current directory).

	The -G flag formats all output (and batch input for form commands
	with -i) as marshalled Python dictionary objects.

	The -Mj flag formats all output (and batch input for form commands
	with -i) as strict line-delimited JSON.  Non-UTF8 data will be
	converted to the Unicode replacement character.

	The -ztag flag is required for all marshalled output flags.

	The -H flag specifies the host name, overriding the value of
	$P4HOST in the environment and the default (the hostname).

	The -I flag specifies that progress indicators, if available,
	are desired.  Progress indicators are available for the commands:
	'p4 -I submit', 'p4 -I sync -q', 'p4 -I switch', 'p4 clone',
	'p4 -I fetch', 'p4 -I push', 'p4 -I zip', and 'p4 -I unzip'.
	This flag is not compatible with the -s, -e, -G options.

	The -L flag specifies the language for text messages from the
	server, overriding the value of $P4LANGUAGE in the environment.
	Setting this option only works if the administrator has loaded
	support for non-English messages into the server database.

	The -p flag specifies the server's listen address, overriding the
	value of $P4PORT in the environment and the default (perforce:1666).

	The -P flag specifies the password, overriding the value of
	$P4PASSWD in the environment.

	The -q flag suppresses all info messages.

	The -Q flag specifies the client's command character set,
	overriding the value of $P4COMMANDCHARSET in the environment.
	See 'p4 help charset' for more information.

	The -r flag specifies the number of times a sync command should be
	retried if the network times out (takes longer than N seconds to
	respond to a single I/O operation) during sync command execution.
	For example:
           p4 -r4 -vnet.maxwait=300 sync //...
	specifies to retry this 'sync' up to 4 times, should any single
	network operation take longer than 5 minutes to complete. The -r
	flag should not be used on a command which reads from stdin.

	The -s flag causes the p4 command line client program to prefix
	each line of output with a tag (error, warning, info, text, exit)
	to make it easier to use for scripting.

	The -u flag specifies the user name, overriding the value of
	$P4USER, $USER, and $USERNAME in the environment.

	The -x flag instructs p4 to read arguments, one per line, from the
	specified file.  If you specify '-', standard input is read.

	The -V flag displays the version of the p4 client command and exits.

	The -z tag option returns output of reporting commands in the
	format returned by 'p4 fstat'.

	The --no-script flag disables client-side Extensions.

    Unsupported or obsolete Helix Core commands and options:

    p4 admin dump
	Outputs a checkpoint of the server through the client.  Important:
	read-locks the database during the entire operation!  Normally
	database locks are not held during network I/O to the client.
	This command requires 'super' access.

    p4 admin import [-l] [-b batchsz] [-f]
	Imports a journal of the server through the client.  The journal
	data is read from the standard input.  When the data has been
	transfered to the server, it is processed in batches with the
	batch size of 5000 records or the number specified with the '-b'
	flag.  Each batch locks only the tables that will change.
	The -l flag instructs import to write-lock all database tables
	and processes all data until it comes to the end of the file or
	encounters an error.  When applying records to the database, it
	ignores failures to delete records,  unlike 'p4d -jr', which
	normally terminates if it can't delete a record as indicated by
	the journal.  Avoid using this command to import large journal
	files, because the entire file has to fit in memory.
	The -f flag forces a replica server to run this command.
	This command requires 'super' access.

    p4 branch -F stream [ -P parent ] -o name
	The -F flag used with -o will output the full branch spec generated
	using the named stream view that includes imported paths. The
	optional -P option allows a user to specify a different parent
	stream for the branch source.

    p4 client -of
	An administrator may combine the -o and -f flags in order to display
	information about the client view havemaps. Havemaps are created when
	a client view is modified.

    p4 clone -A
	The -A flag excludes archive content for the new revisions. This flag
	also prevents the automatic sync normally performed by clone.

    p4 configure help undoc
	Displays all the undocumented configurables.

    p4 configure help all
	Displays both the documented and the undocumented configurables.

    p4 configure show env
	Displays the command-line flags and environment variables that were
	in effect when this server was started.

    p4 configure show undoc
	Displays a list of all the server tunable parameters and their
	current values. Consult Perforce Technical Support before
	changing values.

    p4 copy -e
	Only existing source files are considered for copying to the target.
	Target files with no corresponding source files are ignored.

    p4 copy -E
	This has the same effect as setting dm.integ.tweaks to 32 for
	the current command. It disables a readded/moved file integration
	algorithm.

    p4 cstat
	Dump change/sync status for current client.
	See 'p4 help cstat'.

    p4 dbpack
	Reorder database index pages.
	See 'p4 help dbpack'

    p4 diff2 -F stream [-P parent] [[file1] file2]
	The -F flag causes diff2 to use the full stream branch, including
	imported paths, to determine the pairs of files to compare. The files
	are compared against the parent stream. The optional -P flag allows
	a user to specify a different parent stream to diff against. If file
	arguments are also present, they can further limit the files and
	specify the revisions for comparison.

    p4 diff/diff2/describe -dh
	The -dh compares files on a word-by-word basis (using whitespace
	as a separator rather than just newline), and marks differences
	with HTML tags that switch the font to red or blue for words that
	are only in the first or second file, respectively.

    p4 diff/diff2/describe -dv
	The -dv compares files on a word-by-word basis (using character
	classes rather than just newline), and marks differences with
	HTML tags that switch the font to red or blue for words only
	in the first or second file, respectively.

    p4 discover
	This variant of 'p4 info' is used to discover if a server is
	in unicode mode or not.  It's important to allow this through
	a broker.

    p4 duplicate
	Duplicate revisions and their integration history.
	See 'p4 help duplicate'.

    p4 edit/delete -L [file ...]
	The -L flag can be used with multiple file arguments in order to
	process them altogether.  This flag can help performance when dealing
	with many +l files and issuing the command from an edge server.

    p4 fetch [-p target -A -I -u]
	The -p flag specifies the address of the target server, overriding
	the address from the remote spec specified by the -r flag.

	The -I flag excludes integration records for the new revisions.

	The -A flag excludes archive content for the new revisions. This flag
	also prevents the automatic sync normally performed by fetch.

	The -u flag specifies that conflicting changes should be unsubmitted,
	not relocated to a tangent. The -u flag requires the -r flag, and
	also requires that an administrator has set server.allowrewrite=1.

    p4 filelog -1
	This flag prevents filelog from following any renames resulting from
	use of the 'p4 move' command. By default, filelog follows moved files.

    p4 fstat [-Dcdh]
	The -D flag effectively runs 'p4 dirs' on the same path that was
	passed to 'p4 fstat', appending 'dirs'-like output to the normal
	'fstat' output.  The -cdh subflags correspond to 'p4 dirs -CDH'.
	Use a placeholder (e.g. -Dx) for default 'p4 dirs'-like behavior.

    p4 fstat [-OcChiz]
	The -Oc flag outputs the path, revision and type of the server
	archive file (requires 'admin' privilege). The -OC flag is the same
	as -Oc, but includes archived revisions. The -Oz flag outputs the
	path and revision of any lazy copies (requires 'admin' privilege).
	The -Oh flag outputs the size, digest and any selected attributes
	of the synced revision rather than the head revision. The -Oi flag
	outputs extra (debugging) information about the attributes.

    p4 index
	Add words to the jobs index.

    p4 integrate -1 -2 -C changelist# -Rlou -Znnn
	The flag '-1' can be supplied to the 'p4 integrate' command to
	force consideration of direct integration history only.  Note that -1
	is not allowed if the integration target is a task stream.  The -C
	changelist# flag considers only	integration history from changelists
	at or below the given number, allowing you to ignore credit from
	subsequent integrations.  The -2 flag uses the old 'second generation'
	integrate engine (2006.1).  The -Rl flag causes only edited revisions
	to require integration.  The -Ro flag suppresses the scheduling of
	non-content resolves.  The -Ru flag causes resolves to be scheduled
	for 'undone' changes.  The -Z flag overrides the dm.integ.tweaks
	configurable setting.

    p4 integrate -Dst -d -i -I -o -t
	These flags are deprecated but preserved for backward compatibility.
		-Dt     If the target file has been deleted and the source
			file has changed, re-branch the source file on top
			of the target file instead of scheduling a resolve.
		-Ds     If the source file has been deleted and the target
			file has changed, delete the target file instead of
			scheduling a resolve.
		-d	Synonym for '-Dist'.
		-i/-I	Use the first revision of the source as the base for
			baseless merges, rather than an empty file.
		-o	Synonym for '-Ob'.
		-t	Force filetype and attributes to be copied from the
			source file rather than scheduling resolves.

    p4 jobspec presets
	Preset values for job non-optional fields that undergo variable
	expansion, in addition to the simple $now, $blank, and $user
	substitution.  The variables supported include: %%old%% (previous
	contents of field), %%action%% (what caused the update of the form),
	%%n%% (a newline), %%date%% (date and time), %%day%% (date only),
	and %%user%%.

    p4 jobspec codes over 10000
	Jobspec field codes are required to be in the range 100-199 or over
	10000.

    p4 merge [options] -b branch [-r] [toFile[revRange] ...]
    p4 merge [options] -b branch -s fromFile[revRange] [toFile ...]
    p4 merge [options] -S stream [-P parent] [-F] [-r] [toFile[revRange]...]
	The typical use of 'p4 merge' is to merge into the current stream
	from its parent stream (or the stream specified by --from). More
	advanced usages of 'p4 merge' are possible, using the flags as
	described by 'p4 help integ'.

    p4 merge3
	Three-way file merge.
	See 'p4 help merge3'.
	Undoc '-d' flags for 'resolve' (below) apply to 'merge3' as well.

    p4 obliterate [ -iI ]
	Tells obliterate to synthesize new integration records to attempt
	to bridge the gaps left by the obliteration of intermediate branches.
	If '-i' is used, only the initial branch records are considered; if
	'-I' is used, all records are considered.  Note that it is possible
	to end up with more integration records than you started with.

    p4 pull -I
	The '-I' flag specifies the pull interval in milliseconds.

    p4 push [-p target -I]
	The -p flag specifies the address of the target server, overriding
	the address from the remote spec specified by the -r flag.

	The -I flag excludes integration records for the new revisions.

    p4 resolve -dg
	The'-dg' flag makes the default merge algorithm more guarded about
	merging adjacent chunks.  When this option is specified,
	more conflicts are returned,  especially where changes in both
	'yours' and 'theirs' are identical but then diverge.

    p4 resolve -dt
	Enables two-way merging, similar to integrate between unrelated files.
	The base is ignored, and all diffs are treated as conflicts.

    p4 resolve -dx
	The '-dx' flag makes the default merge algorithm less likely to
	remove duplicate lines when merging adjacent chunks.  When this
	option is specified, blocks that contain identical lines in both
	'yours' and 'theirs' but are not totally the same will be fully
	inserted. This behavior tends to perform similar to 'diff3'.

    p4 resolve -e
	Translates all 'ignored' results to 'edit from', leaving the contents
	unchanged.  The resulting revision is a candidate for integration back
	to its source, which has the effect of undoing the 'ignored' change.

    p4 retype
	Change revision or server archive type.
	See 'p4 help retype'.

    p4 search
	Search index.
	See 'p4 help search'.

    p4 storage [ -R [ -f | -S ] | -r | -s ]
	These options to 'p4 storage' all have significant performance
	impacts on a running server and extreme caution must be exercised
	before considering invoking one of them. They all require 'super'
	access.

	The -R flag discards and rebuilds both storage tables. The discard
	actions are journalled. This in effect reruns the storage upgrade
	process performed when migrating to server release 19.1. The upgrade
	process has two phases. During phase one all commands that access any
	of the storage or revision tables will be blocked. Once the upgrade
	process enters phase two, then only commands that remove revisions will
	be prohibited. When this option is invoked on a commit server, the
	upgrade request will be transmitted to any downstream edge servers,
	triggering them to instigate a storage upgrade. Rather than
	using this option, the recommended method of rebuilding the storage
	tables is to shutdown the server and use:
	'p4d -r $P4ROOT -xU BuildStorage191'.
	During the execution of a 'p4 storage -R' command, it can be terminated
	once it enters phase 2 of the storage upgrade process. When it is
	terminated in this way, the server will terminate in an orderly
	manner, allowing the upgrade process to be restarted by using the
	'-r' option to p4 storage. If instead, a full restart is required,
	then the '-f' needs to be used to force the command to discard
	the existing state of the upgrade process. e.g.
	'p4 storage -R -f'

	The -S option can be provided with -R to only discard and rebuild
	the shelf storage table (db.storagesh). As it only deals with the
	shelf revisions and they are handled in phase 1 of the storage
	upgrade process, no phase 2 of the upgrade process is performed.
	Similar to just the -R option, the command will block all user
	requests attempting access to any revision table while active.
	This option will trigger a storage upgrade of any downstream edge.

	The -r option to 'p4 storage' restarts a previously interrupted
	storage upgrade process initiated by a call to 'p4 storage -R'.
	The storage upgrade process will be continued from where it
	had reached when it was terminated. The storage upgrade process
	is also resumed when the server is restarted.

	The -s flag requests a consistency check of the storage and revision
	tables. It checks that the reference count in the storage records
	correctly numbers the active revision records. This command share
	locks all the revision and storage tables and so blocks all commands
	that wish to update any of those tables whilst this command is active.
	The command builds an in memory structure to track the reference
	counts and is therefore limited by the amount of physical memory
	on the server. Any inconsistancies are reported in the output
	of the command.

	You are strongly encouraged to only use these p4 storage options
	after discussion with Perforce Support.

    p4 streamlog -H
	The documented '-h' follows both 'branch' and content.
	This undocumented '-H' follows only content.
	See 'p4 help streamlog'.

    p4 submit -c <change> --forcenoretransfer
	This option instructs submit to bypass the client file transfer if
	the archive is found to be already present on the server. If the
	archive is found, submit will bypass the client file transfer and
	commit the archive content even if it differs from the client file
	content. This option is only allowed if the undocumented tunable
	value 'submit.forcenoretransfer' is set to 1 or higher. If the
	tunable is set to 2, 'submit -c N' defaults to --forcenoretransfer.
	Files submitted without a file transfer are recorded with no digest
	value; you may set the digest later if desired, for example by
	running verify or by other means. NOTE: bypassing file transfer
	is a very advanced feature requiring specific workflows to be
	used and with specific restrictions to its operation.

    p4 submit -t
	Tamper-checks branch/sync files and files resolved with 'at'
	(copy from/lazy-copied files). This check can significantly slow
	submit.
	Imported files are never tamper-checked.

    p4 unload -o localFile
	The -o localFile flag redirects the output to the specified file on
	the client filesystem. The client, label, or stream is not actually
	unloaded; instead, the data that would have been written to the
	unload depot is written to the local file.

    p4 unsubmit -c N
	Unsubmits the specified changelist by changelist number. Each
	changelist is unsubmitted independently, but if you specify
	multiple interdependent changelists, you must specify them in
	descending changelist order.

    p4 -ztzoffset=N verify
	Operating a replica in a timezone other than the master's timezone
	can cause files of type +k which use $Date$ or $DateTime$ keywords
	to verify as BAD! Specify the master's timezone offset to cause the
	replica to use that timezone for keyed file verification. This value
	does not, however, affect the time zone name shown by $DateTimeTZ$.

    Overlay mapping legacy behavior
	The map.overlay.legacy configurable can be set in order to revert
	overlay mapping behavior to its pre-2023.1 state.  This configurable
	is currently scheduled to be removed in the 2025.1 release.

    Predefined Trigger Actions
	The predefined trigger actions 'pass' and 'fail' are processed
	by the server without calling any external scripts. 'pass' will
	always succeed. 'fail' will always fail and return the expanded
	argument list as the error message.

    Relative revisions @<, @<=, @>, @>=, @=
	            and #<, #<=, #>, #>=, #=
	Anywhere a revision range can be specified, the revisions can be
	modified with relative operators.  Relative operators on #head
	(other than = and <=) aren't supported.  A maximum of 4 revision
	specifications (separated by ,s) are allowed: the implied operator
	on the first is >=; thereafter <=.  You must quote < and > for the
	command-line shell.  See 'p4 help revisions' for a description of
	revision specifications.

    Revision actions #add, #edit, #delete, #branch, #integrate, #import
	Selects all revisions with the specified action.  Actions are not
	relative, which means that #action cannot be used in a revision range.
	For many commands, when multiple revisions of the same
	file are selected, the highest revision is used.

    FileType modifier +T
	The +T modifier stores the revisions in the server in a database
	file called tiny.db, which is useful for lots of very small
	files.  The types ttext and tbinary are equivalent to text+T and
	binary+T.  tiny.db is not backed up with a normal checkpoint.
	Backups are done via 'p4d -xf 857 > tiny.ckp' and restores with
	'p4d -xf 857 tiny.ckp'

    Versioned character set
	Set the server.filecharset configurable to 1 in order to version
	the charset of individual unicode files along with the filetype.
	With this configurable enabled, each unicode file has a charset
	associated with it that will be used instead of the local P4CHARSET
	when reading and writing the file in the client workspace.  This
	versioned charset is set to the local P4CHARSET on add by default
	and may be changed explicitly by using the -Q flag on add, edit, and
	reopen.  The 'p4 reopen -X -Q charset' command will convert the client
	file's contents into the new charset; otherwise it is assumed that the
	client file already matches the newly specified charset.  Note that
	this feature requires client-side support; if not all client
	applications in use support this feature, confusing behavior may
	result.

    Jobspec format
	The 'p4 jobspec' form can have an additional field 'Formats:' to
	help Helix Core visual clients display forms properly.  Each row
	of the Format field consists of three words: field, order, and format.
	The order is an integer (starting at 1) indicating the display order
	(the display order is otherwise undefined).
	The format is: normal, L, R, or I; for full line, left half,
	right half, indented.  If a right field follows a left, they
	are displayed on the same line.

    JobStatus field on 'p4 change', 'p4 submit'
	'p4 change' and 'p4 submit' forms have a 'JobStatus' field that is not
	normally displayed.  This field sets the fix status for all jobs,
	overriding the default (which is 'closed').  A job's fix status can be
	set using the 'p4 change -s' and 'p4 submit -s' commands.

    p4 -zmaxLockTime=n command
    p4 -zmaxOpenFiles=n command
    p4 -zmaxResults=n command
    p4 -zmaxScanRows=n command
    p4 -zmaxMemory=n command

	Overrides the user's maxLockTime/maxOpenFiles/maxResults/maxScanRows
	for the command. Note that the server.commandlimits configurable
	affects the operation of these command-level overrides.

    p4 -e
	Extended version of the '-s' output that displays more detailed
	information about each error/info message received, including the
	formatting strings, unique error codes, and severity values that
	are available to API users.

    p4 -E P4VAR=value
	Override the value of an arbitrary environment/config variable,
	as in a P4CONFIG file.  Multiple instances of this flag can be used.
	Useful for variables without dedicated override flags (such as P4DIFF).

    p4 -F formatstring
	Override the formatting string of server messages, allowing output
	to be customized for easier scripting.  Use the '-e' global option
	to see examples of built-in message strings and the dictionary of
	variables associated with each message.  The '-F' option also works
	with the dictionary provided by tagged (-Ztag) output mode.

    p4 --field Field=replacement_text
    p4 --field Field+=extra_text
	Modify the contents of a spec returned by p4 [specname] -o.  The
	modified spec can be piped directly to another command that expects
	a formatted spec, e.g. p4 [specname] -i.)"
R"(

    p4 -R
	Formats all output (and batch input for form commands with -i)
	as marshalled Ruby hash objects.

    p4 -x cmdfile run
	Runs the commands listed in cmdfile one after the next, using a
	single connection to the server.

    p4d -Cn
	Forces the server to operate in case-sensitive mode (n=0) on Windows
	or case-insensitive mode (n=1) on Unix.  n=2 is an experimental
	'hybrid' order that folds case while preserving uniqueness.
	Attempting to change modes after a database is created produces an
	error.

    p4d -In Name
	Directs the server to identify itself with a unique name (P4NAME).
	Enclose the name in quotes if spaces are included.
	Both 'p4d -In name' and P4NAME are deprecated in favour of using
	the 'p4 serverid' command (see 'p4 help serverid').

    p4d -jds dumpfile
	Dumps the server metadata to the specified file. Unlike p4d -jd,
	ignores the table indexes and reads in file system order rather than
	data order.  This option can be useful for recovery if the btree
	index structure becomes corrupt.  This recovery procedure is not
	meant for normal production operation.  Restoring the resulting
	dump file does not compact the btrees as effectively as restoring
	from regular checkpoints does, and such restores take longer to
	complete.

    p4d -xf bugno
	Updates the server data to fix problems due to the
	specified bug number.  Valid values of bugno are as follows:

		857 -- checkpoint/restore tiny.db
		925 -- working and locks table out of sync
		3104 -- early 99.2 resolve bug
		4164 -- early 2000.1 submit bug
		12904 -- replace / with _ in client names
		18362 -- 2005.2 replace 'check' trigger command
		43361 -- 2012.2 - recreate db.have from db.working
		71819 -- 2013.2 - clears unneeded/invalid charset data
		71917 -- 2014.2 - promoted shelved changes on commit server
		103829 -- 2020.2 - disable all authentication extensions

    p4d -xf update.change.identity //path/to/files/...
	Retrospectively applies the server's configured submit.identity
	algorithm to generate identities for changes that may have touched
	the specified files and have not yet been assigned an identity.

    p4d -xU upgrade
	Re-runs the named upgrade step that is normally done automatically by
	p4d -xu.  To display a list of steps, issue the 'p4d -xU help' command.
	This option can be used to rebuild certain tables (like db.storage).

    p4d -xi[n] [-o output]
	Produces a jnl.invalid-utf8 file if any invalid entries found.
	Use -o flag to specify a filename other than jnl.invalid-utf8.
	Specify 'n' to only validate database without switching to Unicode.

    p4d -xr
	Does a low-level verification and repair of database files.
	Use only as a last resort if checkpoint and journal are not
	available.

    p4d -xrU
	Resets the UnlockCount of database files, but makes no other repairs.
	Use only as a last resort if checkpoint and journal are not
	available.

    p4d -xrc
	Consolidates leaf pages and recovers lost internal nodes in the btree.

    p4d -p <serverlevel> -jd
	The -p flag directs the server to dump metadata in a form compatible
	with an older server version.  The earliest version that might work
	is 2005.1, which is server level 19.

    p4d -m rcsfiles...
	Dumps RCS metadata from files to a format suitable for the
	CVS-to-Perforce conversion script.

    p4d -M readonly [options]
	The -M readonly option, used only with replica servers, directs
	the replica server to only accept readonly metadata commands.
	This overrides the db.replication configurable.

    p4d -D readonly|shared|ondemand|cache|none [options]
	The -D flag is used only with replica servers to specify the
	approach for handling depot file content. A replica running
	with '-D readonly' automatically transfers copies of the target
	server's files. A replica running with '-D shared' or '-D ondemand'
	either shares the same physical archives as the target or uses
	external archive synchronization from the target. A replica running
	with '-D cache' only requests file transfer as needed by user
	commands. A replica running with '-D none' rejects any command that
	requires access to depot files. This overrides the lbr.replication
	configurable.

    p4p -k ...
	Start the Helix Core Proxy without cache timestamp checking.
	The Helix Core Proxy normally uses a timestamp on cached revisions
	to check that the right revision is delivered if an obliterate
	deletes a revision that is subsequently replaced with an identically-
	numbered revision.  Using this option causes problems if head
	revisions are obliterated.  However, the proxy cache can be pre-
	loaded with the server's archive files by specifying this flag
	when you start the proxy.

    p4p -w ...
	Start the Helix Core Proxy in read-only cache mode.  In this mode
	the proxy never updates its cache, which is useful if the cache
	is updated through a WAN NFS or other system-level remote
	filesystem method.

    P4AUTH=central-server-address
	P4AUTH functionality is now fully supported for 2010.2, see the
	Helix Core Server Administrator Guide: Multi-Site Deployment for
	more details.

    P4CHANGE=central-server-address
	P4CHANGE functionality is now fully supported for 2010.2, see the
	Helix Core Server Administrator Guide: Multi-Site Deployment for
	more details.

    P4LOG=syslog
	Uses syslog instead of the named error log file for server error
	logging.  Must be set in server's environment.

    P4DEBUG=server=2
	Logs server commands to the file configured by P4LOG.  The server=2
	option logs command completion. Must be set in server's environment.
	To disable all command logging, set server=0.

    Helix Core Server configurables (unsupported)
    P4DEBUG=configurables
	For information about supported server configuration variables, see
	'p4 help configurables'.

	The following server parameters can be tuned using 'p4 configure set'
	or by setting P4DEBUG to a list of variable=value pairs separated by
	commas. Change these values only as directed by Technical Support.

	Values that are too large or small are silently corrected.

    For details about configuring Windows settings, issue the 'p4 help set'
    command.  The syntax for setting an environment variable depends on the
    OS/shell.  Many shells permit you to set shell variables separately from
    environment variables, but Helix Core cannot access the shell variable,
    only the environment variable.

    Variables of primary interest to typical users are:
    $P4CLIENT, $P4PORT and $P4PASSWD.

    File types supported by Helix Core:

	Helix Core file type determines how the file is handled on both the
	client and the server.

	A filetype can be specified as 'type', with modifiers as 'type+mods'
	or as just the modifiers '+mods'.

	The following are the base Helix Core filetypes:

	    Type        Client Use              Server Storage
	    ----        ----------              --------------
	    text        newlines translated     deltas in RCS format
	    binary      raw bytes               compressed binary
	    symlink     symbolic link           deltas in RCS format
	    apple       Mac resource + data     compressed AppleSingle
	    resource    Mac resource fork       compressed binary
	    unicode     newlines translated     deltas in RCS format
	                                        stored as UTF-8
	    utf8	newlines translated     deltas in RCS format
	                client file UTF-8  	stored as UTF-8
	    utf16	newlines translated     deltas in RCS format
	                client file UTF-16      stored as UTF-8

	                Files of type utf16 are stored in the depot in UTF-8.
	                These files are in utf16 in the client workspace.
	                The automatic type detection requires a BOM be present
	                at the start of the file.  Files without a BOM are
	                assumed to be in client byte order.  When utf16 files
	                are written to a client, they are written with a BOM
	                in client byte order.

	The following are the modifiers:

	    Modifier    Meaning
	    --------    -------
	    +m		always set modtime on client
			(overrides client's nomodtime)
	    +w          always writable on client
	    +x          exec bit set on client

	    +k		$Keyword$ expansion of Id, Header, Author
			Date, DateUTC, DateTime, DateTimeUTC, DateTimeTZ
			Change, File, Revision
	    +ko         $Keyword$ expansion of ID, Header only
	    +l		exclusive open: disallow multiple opens

	    +C          server stores compressed file per revision
	    +D          server stores deltas in RCS format
	    +F          server stores full file per revision, uncompressed
	    +S          server stores only single head revision
	    +S<n>       server stores <n> number of revisions, where <n>
	                is a number 1-10 or 16,32,64,128,256,512.
	    +X		server runs archive trigger to access files

	The following aliases for filetypes are supported for backwards
	compatibility:

	'p4 add', 'p4 edit', and 'p4 reopen' accept the '-t filetype'
	flag to specify the filetype.  If you omit the -t flag, 'p4 add'
	determines filetype using its own logic and the name-to-type
	mapping table managed by 'p4 typemap', if configured.
	'p4 edit -t auto' will determine the filetype by the above mentioned
	logic.

	By default, 'p4 edit' and 'p4 reopen' reuse the current file
	filetype, and 'p4 add' determines the filetype by examining the
	file's contents and its execute permission bits.

	If a filetype is specified using only '+mods, then that filetype
	is combined with the default.  Most modifiers are simply added to
	the default type, but the +C, +D, and +F storage modifiers replace
	the storage method.  To remove a previously assigned modifier, the
	whole filetype must be specified.

   Helix Core job views:

	A job view is an expression that selects jobs according to word
	and date matches.  Job views are used by the 'p4 jobs' -e flag
	to select the jobs to be displayed.  The 'p4 user' form contains
	a JobView field, which selects the jobs that are added to newly-
	created changelists.

	'p4 job' indexes all whitespace-separated words and all punctuation-
	separated words within those words.  So 'sub-par' is entered into
	the index as 'sub', 'par', and 'sub-par'.  Case is not considered.
	'p4 job' separately indexes all date fields in a way that enables
	you to search for a range of dates.

	In its simplest form, a job view is a list of words separated by
	spaces, used to select jobs. For a match to occur, all the specified
	words must appear somewhere in the job, except for date fields:

		JobView: GUI redrawing bug
		p4 jobs -e 'GUI redrawing bug'

	To match the contents of a particular field, use the 'field=word'
	syntax:

		JobView: GUI redrawing status=open

	Logical operators & (and), | (or), ^ (not), and () (grouping) can
	also be used. Spaces are treated as a low-precedence 'and' operator:

		JobView: redrawing (type=bug|type=sir) status=open

	The ^ (not) operator can be used only in conjunction with the & (and)
	or space (and) operators:

		JobView: type=bug & ^status=closed

	The comparative operators >, >=, <, <=, and = succeed if any
	word in the field matches, so only the = operator
	is useful for matching fields that contain blocks of text:

		JobView: priority<=b description=gui

	Text searches can use the * wildcard, which matches anything:

		JobView: redraw* type=bug

	To match operator characters, escape them with \. To match the
	backslash character, escape it with an additional backslash (\\).

	Date fields can be searched using comparative operators.  Specify
	dates using the format yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm:ss.  If you
	omit the time, the equality operators (=, <=, >=) match the whole day:

		JobView: reported_date>=1998/01/01 status=closed

	Text field comparisons are done alphabetically. Date field
	comparisons are done chronologically.

    Specifying file revisions and revision ranges:

	You can limit the effect of some commands to a single file revision
	or a range of revisions, by appending one of the following revision
	specifiers to the file specification:

	    #rev - A revision number or one of the following keywords:
	    #none - A nonexistent revision (also #0).
	    #head - The current head revision (also @now).
	    #have - The revision on the current client.
	    @change - A change number: the revision as of that change.
	    @client - A client name: the revision on the client.
	    @label - A label name: the revision in the label.
	    @date - A date or date/time: the revision as of that time.
		    Either yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm:ss
		    Note that yyyy/mm/dd means yyyy/mm/dd:00:00:00.
		    To include all events on a day, specify the next day.

	Only matching revisions are processed. If you use a label to refer to
	a file that the label doesn't contain, the file is not processed.

	If you omit the revision specification, the default is usually #head.

	If you specify a revision or range and omit the file specification,
	the command affects all relevant files. For example, #head refers
	to the head revision of all files in the depot, and @label refers
	to the revisions of all files in the specified label.

	Files that have been shelved can be accessed by the 'p4 diff',
	'p4 diff2', 'p4 files' and 'p4 print' commands using the revision
	specification '@=change', where 'change' is the pending changelist
	number.

	Some commands accept a range of revisions, specified as the start
	and end revisions separated by a comma. If a single revision is
	specified where a revision range is expected, the revision specifies
	the end revision, and the start defaults to revision #1.

	'p4 obliterate' is an exception: a single revision means only
	that revision.

	If you omit the revision specifier, the default is all revisions.

    Helix Core views:

	A Helix Core view maps file names from the depot to the client
	workspace (client view) or to another part of the depot
	(branch view), or selects a subset of the depot (label view).

	A view is one or more mappings, and each mapping is a pair of file
	names on a line.  The left side always refers to the depot namespace;
	the right side refers to the client or depot namespace.  Each name
	is in Helix Core syntax: it begins with //, followed by the client or
	depot name, then the file name. If the path contains whitespace, it
	must be double-quoted.  Helix Core syntax uses forward slashes (/) as
	directory separators. Example:  "//depot/a dir/file.c"

	Mappings can contain wildcards. Wildcards on the right and left sides
	of a mapping must match. Valid wildcards are:

		*			Matches any characters except /
		... 			Matches any characters, including /
		%%%%1 to %%%%9 		Like *, but used to reorder the path

	If more than one mapping line refers to the same files, the later
	mapping line overrides the earlier one.

	A mapping line that begins with a + overlays the later mapping on
	an earlier one: if files match both the earlier and later mappings,
	then the file matching the later mapping is used. Overlay mappings
	are supported only for client views, and enable you to map multiple
	server directories to the same client directory.  When multiple
	directories are overlaid in this way, only the last one is writable.

	A mapping line that begins with a & does not override earlier mappings
	for the same depot path, allowing multiple 'ditto' versions of the
	same depot file to be synced to one workspace.  Ditto mappings are
	supported only for client views, and files mapped in this way are
	read-only.

	To exclude matching files, precede the mapping with a minus sign (-).

    Limiting data access:

	To avoid swamping servers with requests that result in large datasets,
	the Helix Core super-user can limit the amount of data that the server
	handles for client operations.

	The following limits can be set: MaxResults, MaxScanRows, MaxLockTime
	MaxOpenFiles, and MaxMemory.  If an operation exceeds any of these
	limits, the whole operation fails.

	MaxResults limits the number of rows of result data buffered and
	prevents the server from using excessive memory.

	MaxScanRows limits the number of rows of data considered and prevents
	the server from making large-scale scans.

	MaxLockTime limits the amount of time spent during data scans to
	prevent the server from locking tables for too long.  MaxLockTime
	starts counting when the first table is locked, and includes time
	spent waiting for any subsequent table locks.

	MaxOpenFiles limits the number of files that can be opened by a single
	operation and prevents users from accidentally opening an excessive
	portion of the repository.

	MaxMemory limits the number of megabytes of memory that a command may
	use. Note that this is not a hard limit, but best-effort.
	This applies to Helix Core Servers running on Linux or Windows, but is
	not supported for MacOS.

	To set limits for groups of users, issue the 'p4 group' command.

	You may wish to additionally set server.commandlimits=2 in order to
	disable overriding these settings on a per-command basis.

	Each group has MaxResults, MaxScanRows, MaxLockTime, MaxOpenFiles and
	MaxMemory fields, which limit the resources committed to operations
	performed by members of the group.  For these fields, 'unlimited'
	or 'unset' means no limit for that group.  An individual user's
	limit is the highest of any group with a limit to which he belongs,
	unlimited if any of his groups has 'unlimited' for that field, or
	unlimited if he belongs to no group with a limit.

	For naive users, set MaxResults to a value that is larger than the
	number of files likely to reside in any of their client workspaces.
	Set MaxScanRows to MaxResults multiplied by the average number of
	revisions per file in the repository.  As a rule, neither need to
	be smaller than 10000 or 50000 (respectively), and values of 50000
	and 250000 are probably sufficient to prevent accidental misuse
	without interfering with normal use.  Set MaxLockTime to a value
	in the 1000-30000 (1-30 second) range.  Set MaxOpenFiles to a value
	that is smaller than MaxResults, but larger than the number of files
	likely to exist in a single project.

	Most commands which enforce entity limits count either files or
	revisions of files. A single file may have many revisions, so the
	number of revisions of a set of files is always at least as large
	as the number of files in that set. Some commands track other types
	of entities, as explained below.

	The following table lists the commands that are controlled by these
	limits, the entity that is counted, and tells you how to adjust the
	operation to run within the limit.

	If (and only if) P4CHARSET is set for the client, the server
	must also be operating in Unicode mode.  This mode is switched
	on (and never off) by invoking 'p4d -xi' on the server.  This
	operation verifies that all existing metadata is valid UTF8,
	and then sets the protected counter 'unicode' to indicate that
	the server now runs in Unicode mode.

	If P4CHARSET is not set explicitly when connecting to a Unicode mode
	server, a default charset will be chosen based on the client's
	platform and/or code page.

	In Unicode mode, all non-file data (identifiers, descriptions,
	etc) and the content of files of type 'unicode' are translated
	between the character set configured on the client by P4CHARSET
	and UTF8 in the server.

	P4CHARSET is supported by 2001.2 and later clients.

	When P4CHARSET is set to one of the UTF-16 values, P4COMMANDCHARSET
	must be set to a non-utf-16 value for the p4 command-line client to
	operate correctly.  This configuration enables P4CHARSET to control
	the translation of file revision contents while using a command
	line system that is not utf-16 based (because most command lines
	are not utf-16 compatible).  All UTF-16 values honor a file's Byte-
	Order-Mark when a file is read. When a file is written, the specified

    add -- Open a new file to add it to the depot

    p4 add [-c changelist#] [-d -f -I -n] [-t filetype] file ...

	Open a file for adding to the depot.  If the file exists on the
	client, it is read to determine if it is text or binary. If it does
	not exist, it is assumed to be text.  To be added, the file must not
	already reside in the depot, or it must be deleted at the current
	head revision.  Files can be deleted and re-added.

	A 2012.1 client will ignore files that were to be added, if they
	match an exclusion line specified in a P4IGNORE file.

	To associate the open files with a specific pending changelist, use
	the -c flag; if you omit the -c flag, the open files are associated
	with the default changelist.

	As a shortcut to reverting and re-adding, you can use the -d
	flag to reopen currently-open files for add (downgrade) under
	the following circumstances:

	    A file that is 'opened for edit' and is synced to the head
	    revision, and the head revision has been deleted (or moved).

	    A file that is 'opened for move/add' can be downgraded to add,
	    which is useful when the source of the move has been deleted
	    or moved.  Typically, under these circumstances, your only
	    alternative is to revert.  In this case, breaking the move
	    connection enables you to preserve any content changes in the
	    new file and safely revert the source file (of the move).

	To specify file type, use the -t flag.  By default, 'p4 add'
	determines file type using the name-to-type mapping table managed
	by 'p4 typemap' and by examining the file's contents and execute
	permission bit. If the file type specified by -t or configured in
	the typemap table is a partial filetype, the resulting modifier is
	applied to the file type that is determined by 'p4 add'. For more
	details, see 'p4 help filetypes'.

	To add files with filenames that contain wildcard characters, specify
	the -f flag. Filenames that contain the special characters '@', '#',
	'%%' or '*' are reformatted to encode the characters using ASCII
	hexadecimal representation.  After the files are added, you must
	refer to them using the reformatted file name, because Helix Core
	does not recognize the local filesystem name.

	The -I flag informs the client that it should not perform any ignore
	checking configured by P4IGNORE.

	The -n flag displays a preview of the specified add operation without
	changing any files or metadata.

	See 'p4 help-graph add' for information on using this command with

	'p4 admin checkpoint' causes the server to take a checkpoint and
	to copy the journal to a numbered journal file.  This command is
	equivalent to 'p4d -jc'. The '-p' option requests a parallel
	checkpoint. The '-m' option requests a multifile checkpoint and
	may only be specified with the '-p' option.
	The '-N threads' specifies the number of threads to
	use during the parallel request.

	'p4 admin journal' causes the server to save the journal to a
	numbered journal file and then truncate it.  This command is
	equivalent to 'p4d -jj'.

	The -z flag saves the checkpoint and journal in compressed (gzip)
	format, with the '.gz' extension added to the file names.

	The -Z flag saves the checkpoint in compressed (gzip) format,
	with the '.gz' extension added to the file name, but saves
	the journal as plain text (without an appended '.gz' extension).
	This allows a replica to update from the uncompressed journal
	without requiring the replica to stop and restart, while still
	saving disk space by compressing the presumably large checkpoint.

	If a prefix is specified, the files are named prefix.ckp.n and
	prefix.jnl.n respectively, where n is a sequence number. Without
	a prefix, the default filenames are checkpoint.n and journal.n.

	'p4 admin stop' stops the server, terminating any requests currently

	doing. (Windows NT: this command can be used regardless of whether

	'p4 admin restart' restarts the server, terminating any requests

	are taking place, but otherwise does not wait for users to finish what

    p4 journaldbchecksums -c change

	'p4 journaldbchecksums' provides a set of tools for ensuring data
	integrity across a multi-server installation.

	This command enables administrators to compare database contents
	between the master server and its replicas. Important information
	about the results of the command is logged to structured server logs
	as events of type 'integrity', so using this command effectively
	includes defining a log such as 'integrity.csv' to capture these log
	events and then reviewing the log files regularly.

	Effective replica monitoring must be performed regularly, so when
	using the 'p4 journaldbchecksums' command, you should ensure
	that the rpl.checksum.change and rpl.checksum.table configurables
	have been configured to enable routine integrity verification, and
	you should ensure that you regularly inspect your integrity logs for
	indications of problems.

	The rpl.checksum.change configurable can be set to 0,1,2,3; it
	defaults to 0. The levels operate as follows:
	    0: don't do any changelist checksumming
	    1: server writes journal note at end of submit, populate,
	       push, fetch, and unzip commands
	    2: replica should verify the changelist summary, and should
	       write to integrity.csv if the changelist does not match
	    3: replica should write the results to integrity.csv even
	       if the changelist checksum does match

	The rpl.checksum.table configurable can be set to 0,1,2; it
	defaults to 0. The levels operate as follows:
	    0: table-level checksumming only
	    1: journal notes for table-unload and table-scan are processed
	       by the replica, and are logged if the check fails
	    2: results of journal note processing in the replica are
	       logged even if the results match.

	The first form of the 'p4 journaldbchecksums' command causes the
	server to write journal notes containing table checksum information.
	Replica servers will automatically verify the table checksums when
	processing these notes.

	The -t and -T flags specify a list of database tables that are,
	respectively, included or excluded from the set of tables for which
	journal notes are written.  To specify multiple tables, double-quote
	the list and separate the table names with spaces. The table names
	must start with "db.". Table names can also be separated by commas.

	When the server rotates its journal as part of the 'admin checkpoint'
	or 'admin journal' commands, it automatically performs the
	'journaldbchecksums' command; the set of tables included in the
	command is controlled by the rpl.checksum.auto configurable. To
	specify the same set of tables explicitly in the 'journaldbchecksums'
	command, specify the table set level using the -l flag.

	The table set levels for this release are:
	    1: the most important system and revision tables. Checksum errors
	       in these tables should be investigated immediately.
	    2: all tables that should not vary between unfiltered replicas
	    3: all tables, including tables which will vary on build-server
	       and edge-server replicas

	Note that if data filtering is used for a replica, both the table
	and changelist checksums are affected and can be expected to differ.

	The second form of the 'p4 journaldbchecksums' command causes the
	server to unload the database table specified with -t to the file
	specified with -u. The command also writes a journal note describing
	this action, and replica servers will automatically unload the same
	table to the same file when processing these notes. This allows you to
	compare the contents of the table in a time-consistent fashion. This
	command is recommended only for tables that are small. In the case
	of partitioned-jnl have tables, the respective table is unloaded to
	the file where its name is customised accordingly. For example,
	'p4 journaldbchecksums -u unloadhavept -t db.have.pt' command results
	in unloading the table 'db.have.pt%pwsjnl1' to the file
	'unloadhavept_db_pwsjnl1'. The -z flag causes the file specified with
	-u to be saved in compressed format.

	The third form of the 'p4 journaldbchecksums' command causes the
	server to scan the specified database table. The table is scanned
	in blocks; the number of records in a block is specified by the -b
	flag, which defaults to 5,000. For each block, the server computes
	a block checksum and writes it as a journal note. Replica servers
	will automatically verify these blocks when processing these notes.
	This command can be used with large tables on a production system
	as the table is unlocked between each block. Inspecting the results
	of the block verifications will reveal the location of damage which
	affects only part of a database table.

	When unloading or scanning a table, the -v flag specifies the server
	version number to use. If it is not specified, the current server
	version is used.

	The fourth form of the 'p4 journaldbchecksums' command causes the
	server to compute a checksum of an individual submitted changelist.
	This checksum is written as a journal note, and replica servers will
	automatically verify the checksum of the change when processing
	these notes.

	'p4 journaldbchecksums' requires that the user be an operator or
	have 'super' access.

	Sets a user-managed attribute 'name' to a value on opened files.
	If -v, -i, or -I are omitted, the attribute is cleared (if set).

	To display attributes use 'p4 fstat -Oa' or 'p4 print -T'.

	The -e flag indicates that the 'value' is specified in hex.

	The -f flag sets the attribute on submitted files.  If a propagating
	trait is set on a submitted file, a revision specification may not
	be used, and the file must not be currently open on any client.
	The -f flag requires 'admin' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	The -p flag creates an attribute with a value that is propagated
	when the file is opened with 'p4 copy', 'p4 delete', 'p4 edit',
	'p4 integrate', 'p4 reconcile', 'p4 resolve', 'p4 submit', 'p4 shelve',
	or 'p4 unshelve'.

	The -i flag causes the attribute value to be read from the standard
	input. This option supports both text and binary input. Only one
	file argument is allowed when using this option.

	The -I flag causes the attribute value to be read from a file.
	This option supports both text and binary files. This is
	recommended for attribute data that is greater than 250MB in size,
	which might cause the command to fail with the 'Rpc buffer too big'
	error. The '-e' option to specify the value as hex cannot be used
	with this option. Only one file argument is allowed when using this
	option. Also, only one trait value may be set using this option.
	To display attributes set with this option, the 'p4 print -T'
	command is recommended instead of the 'p4 fstat -Oa' command because
	'p4 print -T' can handle larger text data as well as larger
	non-encoded binary data.

	Multiple attributes can be set or cleared by specifying multiple
	'-n name' flags and an equal number of corresponding '-v value'
	flags (to set) or no '-v' flags (to clear). Note that '-v value'
	only supports text data input.

	When an attribute is created, the configurable 'trait.storagedepot.min'
	determines how the attribute is stored. By default, attribute values
	are stored in the db.traits table. The 'trait.storagedepot.min'
	value is used to enable depot storage for new attribute values, and
	also to specify the minimum size in bytes for storing a value in the
	trait depot. When 'trait.storagedepot.min' is set to a value greater
	than 0, the value of a newly created attribute will be stored in the
	trait depot if its size matches or exceeds the trait.storagedepot.min
	value. When 'trait.storagedepot.min' is unset or set to 0, trait values
	are stored in the 'db.traits' table instead.

	The -T option may be used when creating a new attribute to override
	the configurable setting only when the 'trait.storagedepot.min'
	configurable is set to a value greater than 0. The -T0 setting causes
	the value to be stored in the db.traits table. When trait depot
	storage is allowed, the -T1 option specifies that the value will be
	stored in the trait depot even if it does not meet the
	trait.storagedepot.min size.

    backup -- cause a workspace-server to automatically backup its workspaces

    p4 backup"

	'p4 backup' instructs this workspace server to launch a process to
	periodically backup all workspaces on the server. This command is
	valid only when used on p4d servers functioning as cluster
	workspace-servers. The behavior of the backup process is managed
	via two configurables: the client.backup.interval and the
	idle.unload.interval.

	The configurable client.backup.interval causes the command to
	automatically repeat its action every N seconds. If the
	client.backup.interval is not set or set to 0 then
	the command runs once, then exits.

	When set, the idle.unload.interval configurable causes the command

	Each of the workspaces that have a last used time that exceeds the
	specified N number of seconds will be automatically unloaded. If this
	configurable is not set, or set to 0, the auto-unload feature is
	turned off.

	*A user can opt out of having one or more of their workspaces backed
	up by setting the Backup field to 'disable' in that workspace's

	is placed into a form and the user's editor is invoked.

	The -d flag deletes a pending changelist, if it has no opened files
	(or stream spec) and no pending fixes associated with it.  Use
	'p4 opened -a' to report on opened files and 'p4 reopen' to move them
	to another changelist.  Use 'p4 fixes -c changelist#' to report on
	pending fixes and 'p4 fix -d -c changelist# jobs...' to delete pending
	fixes. The changelist can be deleted only by the user and client
	who created it, or by a user with 'admin' privilege using the -f
	flag.

	The -o flag writes the changelist specification to the standard
	output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a changelist specification from the standard
	input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -f flag forces operations on pending and submitted changelists
	and requires 'admin' access granted by 'p4 protect'. The -f and -u
	flags are mutually exclusive. By default, submitted changelists cannot
	be changed. The -f flag forces:

	    - Update or deletion of other users' pending changelists.
	    - Changing the 'User' of an empty pending change via -U.
	    - Deletion of submitted changelists after they have been
	      emptied of files using 'p4 obliterate' and of streams
	      using 'p4 stream --obliterate'.
	    - Update of the 'Description', 'Date', and 'User' fields of
	      submitted changelists.
	    - Display of the 'Description' field in a restricted changelist.

	The -u flag can force the update of a submitted change by the owner
	of the change. Only the Jobs, Type, and Description fields can be
	changed	using the -u flag. The -f and -u flags cannot be used in
	the same change command.

	The -s flag extends the list of jobs to include the fix status
	for each job.  On new changelists, the fix status begins as the
	special status 'ignore', which, if left unchanged simply excludes
	the job from those being fixed.  Otherwise, the fix status, like
	that applied with 'p4 fix -s', becomes the job's status when
	the changelist is committed.  Note that this option exists
	to support integration with external defect trackers.

	The -O flag specifies that the changelist number is the original
	number of a changelist which was renamed on submit.

	The -I flag specifies that the changelist number is the Identity
	field of a changelist.

	The -U flag changes the 'User' of an empty pending change to the
	specified user. The user field can only be changed using this flag
	by the user who created the change, or by a user with 'admin'
	privilege using the -f flag. This option is useful for running
	in a trigger or script.

	The -t flag changes the 'Type' of the change to 'restricted'
	or 'public' without displaying the change form. This option is
	useful for running in a trigger or script.

	The 'Type' field can be used to hide the change or its description
	from users. Valid values for this field are 'public' (default), and
	'restricted'. A shelved or committed change that is 'restricted' is
	accessible only to users who own the change or have 'list' permission
	to at least one file in the change.  A pending (not shelved)
	restricted change is only accessible to its owner.  Public changes
	are accessible to all users. This setting affects the output of the
	'p4 change', 'p4 changes', and 'p4 describe' commands. Note that
	the '-S' flag is required with 'p4 describe' for the command to
	enforce shelved	rather than pending restricted changelist rules.

	If a user is not permitted to have access to a restricted change,
	The 'Description' text is replaced with a 'no permission' message
	(see 'Type' field). Users with admin permission can override the
	restriction using the -f flag.

	In order to delete a pending changelist which is owned by a client

	Saving the file creates or modifies the client spec.

	The client spec contains the following fields:

	Client:      The client name.

		     If unset, access is allowed from any host.

	Owner:       The user who created this client.

	Update:      The date that this spec was last modified.

	Access:      The date that this client was last used in any way.

	Description: A short description of the workspace.

	Root:        The root directory of the workspace (specified in local
		     file system syntax), under which all versioned files
		     will be placed. If you change this setting, you must
		     physically relocate any files that currently reside
		     there.  On Windows client machines, you can specify the
		     root as "null" to enable you to map files to multiple
		     drives.

	AltRoots:    Up to two optional alternate client workspace roots.
		     The first of the main and alternate roots to match the
		     client program's current working directory is used. If
		     none match, the main root is used. 'p4 info' displays
		     the root that is being used.

	Options:     Flags to configure the client behavior. Defaults
		     are marked with *.

		allwrite	Leaves all files writable on the client;
		noallwrite *	by default, only files opened by 'p4 edit'
				are writable. If set, files might be clobbered
				as a result of ignoring the clobber option
				(see below).

		clobber		Permits 'p4 sync' to overwrite writable
		noclobber *	files on the client.  noclobber is ignored if
				allwrite is set.

		compress 	Compresses data sent between the client
		nocompress *	and server to speed up slow connections.

		locked   	Allows only the client owner to use or change
		unlocked *	the client spec.  Prevents the client spec from
				being deleted or unloaded.

		modtime  	Causes 'p4 sync' and 'p4 submit' to preserve
		nomodtime *	file modification time, as with files with the
				+m type modifier. (See 'p4 help filetypes'.)
				With nomodtime, file timestamps are updated by
				sync and submit operations.

		rmdir		Makes 'p4 sync' attempt to delete a workspace
		normdir *	directory when all files in it are removed.

		altsync		Instructs the client to use an alternative sync
		noaltsync *	agent specified with P4ALTSYNC when performing
				file operations in the workspace. This option
				can only be changed when the client's have list
				is empty.

	SubmitOptions:  Flags to change submit behavior.

		submitunchanged     All open files are submitted (default).

		revertunchanged     Files that have content, type, or resolved
		                    changes are submitted. Unchanged files are
		                    reverted.

		leaveunchanged      Files that have content, type, or resolved
		                    changes are submitted. Unchanged files are
		                    moved to the default changelist.

		        +reopen     Can be appended to the submit option flag
		                    to cause submitted files to be reopened in
		                    the default changelist.
		                    Example: submitunchanged+reopen

	LineEnd:    Set line-ending character(s) for client text files.

		local		mode that is native to the client (default).
		unix		linefeed: UNIX style.
		mac		carriage return: Macintosh style.
		win		carriage return-linefeed: Windows style.
		share		hybrid: writes UNIX style but reads UNIX,
				Mac or Windows style.

	View:        Maps files in the depot to files in your client
		     workspace.  Defines the files that you want in your
		     client workspace and specifies where you want them
		     to reside.  The default view maps all depot files
		     onto the client.  See 'p4 help views' for view syntax.
		     A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.

	ChangeView:  Restricts depot paths to a particular point in time.
	             Example: //depot/path/...@1000
	             Revisions submitted to the path after the specified
	             changelist will not be visible.  Files matching a
	             ChangeView path may not be submitted.

	             Automatic labels may also used to specify a particular
	             point in time: the label's 'Revision' field must be set
	             to a changelist number or a date.  If the label has a
	             view, only files that match the intersection of the
	             ChangeViewpath and the label's view will be restricted to
	             the point in time specified by the 'Revision' field; any
	             other files matching the ChangeView path may sync to
	             #head, but cannot be submitted.

	Stream:      The stream to which this client's view will be dedicated.
		     (Files in stream paths can be submitted only by dedicated
		     stream clients.) When this optional field is set, the
		     View field will be automatically replaced by a stream
		     view as the client spec is saved.

	StreamAtChange:
		     Stream meta-data (for view creation) is versioned.
		     When StreamAtChange is set, the stream hierarchy is
		     constructed back-in-time to reproduce the view that was
		     available to clients in the past. With this field set
		     changes cannot be be submitted from the client.
		     StreamAtChange is optional; Stream must be set as well.

	ServerID:    If set, restricts usage to the named server.
		     If unset, usage is allowed on the master server and on
		     any replicas of the master other than Edge Servers.

	Type:        By default all clients are 'writeable', certain clients
		     are short lived and perform long sync and build cycles.
		     Over time these build clients can fragment the 'db.have'
		     table which is used to track what files a client has
		     synced.  Setting a type of 'readonly' gives the client
		     its own personal 'db.have' database table.  A 'readonly'
		     client cannot 'edit' or 'submit' files, however for build
		     automation this is not usually a requirement and the
		     performance tradeoff is worth considering if your build
		     automation is causing issues with the 'db.have' table.
		     This option requires that an administrator has first
		     configured the 'client.readonly.dir' setting.  If it is
		     necessary to submit changes as part of your build,
		     you may specify a 'partitioned' client: like a 'readonly'
		     client, this type also has a separate 'db.have' table
		     under the 'client.readonly.dir' directory, but allows
		     journalled 'edit' and 'submit' of files.

	Note: changing the client root does not actually move the client
	files; you must relocate them manually.  Similarly, changing
	the 'LineEnd' option does not actually update the client files;
	you can refresh them with 'p4 sync -f'.

	The -d flag deletes the specified spec, as long as the client
	workspace has no opened files or pending changes.  (See 'p4 help
	opened'.) The -f flag forces the delete. The -Fs option used with -f
	forces client deletion even when the user has shelved changes. In
	this case, the shelved changes are left intact. The -Fd option with
	-f forces deletion of the client and all its shelved changes.

	The -o flag writes the named client spec to the standard output.
	The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a client spec from the standard input.  The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -t template flag, where 'template' is the name of another client
	spec, causes the View and Options fields to be replaced by those of
	the template.

	The -T type flag lets you set the type of client, this can only be
	set when first creating the client. For classic Helix Core clients
	the default is 'writeable', set this value to 'readonly' for build
	automation or clients that do not need to update content.

	The -f flag can force the updating of locked clients; normally
	locked clients can only be modified by their owner.  -f also allows
	the last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin'
	access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	The -s flag is used to switch an existing client spec's view without
	invoking the editor.  It can be used with -S to switch to a stream
	view, or with -t to switch to a view defined in another client spec.
	Switching views is not allowed in a client that has opened files.
	The -f flag can be used with -s to force switching with opened files.
	View switching has no effect on files in a client workspace until
	'p4 sync' is run.

	Without -s, the '-S stream' flag can be used to create a new client
	spec dedicated to a stream. If the client spec already exists, and
	-S is used without -s, an error occurs when the client is bound to
	a different, or no stream.  Using -S sets the new client's
	Stream field.  The special syntax '-S //a/stream@changelist' can
	be used to set both Stream and StreamAtChange at the same time.

	The '-S stream' flag can be used with '-o -c change' to inspect an
	old stream client view. It yields the client spec that would have
	been created for the stream at the moment the change was recorded.

	A server of type 'build-server' (see 'p4 help server') is a replica
	which supports build farm integration, and the 'p4 client' command
	may be used to create or edit client workspaces on a build-server.
	Such workspaces may issue the 'p4 sync' command, in addition to any
	read-only command supported by the replica. For more information, run
	'p4 help buildserver'.

	When creating or editing a client workspace for a build-server,
	the client specified by the optional 'name' argument, as well as the
	client specified by the $P4CLIENT environment variable or via the
	global '-c client' argument must not exist, or must be restricted
	to this server; this command may not be used to create or edit a
	workspace that is not restricted to this build-server.

	In order to delete a workspace which is bound to a different server,
	specify 'client -d -f --serverid=X', providing the serverid of the
	owning server. This variant of the client command must be issued
	directly to the Commit Server.

	See 'p4 help-graph client' for information on using this command with
	graph depots.

	specified user. This can include wildcards to form a search pattern.
	If wildcards are used enclose the search pattern in double quotes.
	You can also add a --user-case-insensitive flag which will indicate
	that the user value is a case-insensitive search pattern.

	The -e nameFilter flag lists workspaces with a name that matches
	the nameFilter pattern, for example: -e 'svr-dev-rel*'. The -e flag
	uses the server's normal case-sensitivity rules. The -E flag makes
	the matching case-insensitive, even on a case-sensitive server.

	The -m max flag limits output to the specified number of workspaces.

	The -S stream flag limits output to the client workspaces dedicated
	to the stream(s).  A wildcard pattern may be used to match multiple
	streams, or an empty string to match clients with no stream.

	The -U flag lists unloaded clients (see 'p4 help unload').

	The -a flag specifies that all clients should be displayed, not just
	those that are bound to this server.

	The -s serverID flag specifies that only those clients bound to the
	specified serverID should be displayed. On an Edge Server, the -s
	flag defaults to the Edge Server's serverID.

	A stream specification ('spec') names a path in a stream depot to be
	treated as a stream.  (See 'p4 help streamintro'.)  The spec also
	defines the stream's lineage, its view, and its expected flow of
	change.

	The 'p4 stream' command puts the stream spec into a temporary file and
	invokes the editor configured by the environment variable $P4EDITOR.
	When creating a stream, the type of the stream must be specified with
	the '-t' flag.  Saving the file creates or modifies the stream spec.

	By default updates to the stream spec are automatically visible to
	all clients; see 'p4 help streamcmds' for information on 'opening' a
	stream spec to stage updates on one client before submitting them.

	Creating a stream spec does not branch a new stream.  To branch a
	stream, use 'p4 copy -r -S stream', where 'stream' is the name of a
	stream spec.

	The stream spec contains the following fields:

	Stream:   The stream's path in a stream depot, of the form
	          //depotname/streamname. This is both the name of the stream
	          spec and the permanent, unique identifier of the stream.
	          This stream path may extend beyond the traditional form by
	          updating the 'StreamDepth' field in the stream depot when
	          creating a new stream depot.  Here, depth relates to the
	          number of single slashes in stream names following the
	          depot name (so traditional form above reflects StreamDepth
	          of 1.  All streams within a stream depot must adhere to
	          this same format.

	Update:   The date this stream spec was last changed.

	Access:   The date of the last command used with this spec.

	Owner:    The stream's owner. A stream can be owned by a user, or
	          owned by a group. Can be changed.

	Name:     An alternate name of the stream, for use in display outputs.
	          Defaults to the final path in the 'streamname' portion in
	          the stream. Can be changed.

	Parent:   The parent of this stream. Can be 'none' if the stream type
	          is 'mainline',  otherwise must be set to an existing stream
	          identifier, of the form //depotname/streamname.
	          Can be changed.

	Type:     'mainline', 'development', 'release', 'sparsedev',
	          'sparserel', 'task', or 'virtual'. Defines the role of a
	          stream.

	          A 'mainline' has no parent.

	          The 'development', 'release', 'sparsedev', and 'sparserel'
	          streams have controlled flow. This can be changed in the
	          stream Options.

	          'sparsedev' and 'sparserel' are lightweight streams which do
	          not need to be populated when they are created and instead
	          automatically branch files as they are edited. They use the
	          same flow control as 'development' and 'release' streams,
	          respectively.

	          A 'task' stream is meant to be a short-lived stream that only
	          promotes edited files to the repository. It is a best
	          practice to delete or unload unused 'task' streams to avoid
	          unnecessary metadata that otherwise would slow performance.

	          A 'virtual' stream is not a separate set of files, but
	          instead a filtered view of its parent stream

	          Flow control is provided by 'p4 copy -S' and 'p4 merge -S'.
	          These commands restrict the flow of change as follows:

	          Stream Type   Direction of flow     Allowed with
	          -----------   -----------------     ------------
	          development   to parent stream      'p4 copy'
	          sparsedev     to parent stream      'p4 copy'
	          task          to parent stream      'p4 copy'
	          release       to parent stream      'p4 merge'
	          sparserel     to parent stream      'p4 merge'
	          development   from parent stream    'p4 merge'
	          sparsedev     from parent stream    'p4 merge'
	          release       from parent stream    'p4 copy'
	          sparserel     from parent stream    'p4 copy'

	Description: An optional description of the stream.

	Options:  Flags to configure stream behavior. Defaults are marked *:

	          unlocked *      Indicates whether the stream spec is locked
	          locked          against modifications. If locked, the spec
	                          may not be deleted, and only its owner or
	                          group users can modify it.

	          allsubmit *     Indicates whether all users or only the
	          ownersubmit     owner (or group users) of the stream may
	                          submit changes to the stream path.

	          toparent *      Indicates if controlled flow from the
	          notoparent      stream to its parent is expected to occur.

	          fromparent *    Indicates if controlled flow to the stream
	          nofromparent    from its parent is expected to occur.

	          mergedown *     Indicates if merge flow is restricted or
	          mergeany        merge is permitted from any other stream.

	          The [no]fromparent and [no]toparent options determine if
	          'p4 copy -S' and 'p4 merge -S' allow change to flow between
	          a stream and its parent. A 'virtual' stream must have its
	          flow options set as 'notoparent' and 'nofromparent'. Flow
	          options are ignored for 'mainline' streams.

	ParentView: 'inherit' or 'noinherit'.  Defines whether the stream
	          inherits a view from its parent.

	          If a ParentView is inherit, the Paths, Remapped, and Ignored
	          fields will be affected.  The view created from each field is
	          composed of the stream's fields and the set of fields
	          "inherited" from each of the stream's ancestors. The
	          inheritance is implicit, so the inherited Paths, Remapped,
	          and Ignored values will not be displayed with the current
	          stream specification.

	          If a ParentView is noinherit, the Paths, Remapped, and
	          Ignored fields are not affected by the stream's ancestors.
	          The child views are exactly what is specified in the Paths,
	          Remapped, and Ignored fields.

	          Task streams, virtual streams, and sparse streams can only
	          have inherit ParentViews. All other stream types can have
	          inherit or noinherit ParentViews.

	          When a development, release, or mainline stream is first
	          created, the ParentView field may be set with the
	          '--parentview' parameter. The parameter may be set with
	          values 'inherit' or 'noinherit'.

	          When creating a development, release, or mainline stream
	          without the '--parentview' parameter, the configurable
	          dm.stream.parentview will determine the default value for
	          the ParentView field.  The configurable has the following
	          values:

	              0: all new streams have an inherit ParentView.
	              1: all new mainline, development and release streams have
	                 a noinherit ParentView, all new task and virtual
	                 streams have an inherit ParentView.
	              2: all new release streams have a noinherit ParentView,
	                 all new non-release streams have an inherit ParentView
	                 value.

	          The default value for dm.stream.parentview is 0.

	          After a stream has been created, the ParentView field cannot
	          be changed by editing the stream specification.  Instead, use
	          the command 'p4 stream parentview' to change stream's
	          parentview. See 'p4 help streamcmds' for more details.

R"(
	Components:  One or more lines that include other streams' views within
	          the current stream.  Each line is of the form:

	              <component_type> <component_folder> <stream>[@change]
	
	          where

	              <component_type> is a single keyword.

	              <component_folder> a directory path relative to the
	              root of the client workspace.

	              <stream> is the stream path and name of an existing
	              stream.  An optional '@change' or '@automatic_label' can
	              be specified to get the streamviews at or before the
	              given change or automatic label.

	          For example:

	              readonly dirA //stream/mainA@37

	          A component is a stream that contributes its views to the
	          the stream that defines the component. A stream that defines
	          one or more other streams as components is called a consuming
	          stream.

	          If a component is defined to be at a given change, that
	          component's views come from the last time the stream was
	          edited, either at the specified change or earlier. Any file
	          sync'd from a component@change's views will be at a revision
	          at or before the specified change.

	          The component types are:

	              readonly -- all views that originate from the component
	                  are readonly;  files can be sync'd but not edited and
	                  submitted.  Note that if the component has an import+
	                  path, that path is readonly for the consuming stream.

	              writeimport+ -- all views that originate from import+
	                  paths in the component can be opened for edit and
	                  submitted (writable);  all other views that
	                  originate from the component are readonly.

	              writeall -- all views that originate from share, isolate,
	                  or import+ paths in the component can be opened for
	                  edit and submitted (writable);  all other views that
	                  originate from the component are readonly.

	          Note that component stream views will be included when the
	          consuming stream is itself defined as a component for some
	          other stream.  For example:

	              Suppose there are streams //stream/mainA, //stream/mainB,
	              and main //stream/mainC.

	              Suppose that //stream/mainC defines a Path

	                  import libXYZ/lib1.a //libs/libXYZ/lib1.a

	              Then //stream/mainB defines a component

	                  readonly dirC //stream/mainC

	              //stream/mainA defines a component

	                  readonly dirB //stream/mainB

	              Then a workspace ws, which is associated with
	              //stream/mainA, will have views

	                  //stream/mainA/... //ws/...
	                  //stream/mainB/... //ws/dirB/...
	                  //stream/mainC/... //ws/dirB/dirC/...
	                  //libs/libXYZ/lib1.a //ws/dirB/dirC/libXYZ/lib1.a

	          Note that in a chain of components of different types, the
	          most restrictive type becomes the effective component type
	          for views originating from the end component in the chain.

	          For example, if component B is defined as writeall in A, and
	          B has a readonly component C, then the views coming from
	          paths in C are readonly.  Similarly, if B is defined as
	          writeimport+ in A and C is defined as writeall in B, then the
	          views in A which originate from share or isolate paths in C
	          are readonly, while import+ paths in C are writable.

	          The configurable, dm.stream.components, can be used to enable
	          or disable the inclusion of stream components in the
	          workspace view.  Use values

	              0 (default): disables stream components in the workspace
	                  view.

	              1: enables stream components in the workspace view.


	Paths:    One or more lines that define file paths in the stream view.
	          Each line is of the form:

	              <path_type> <view_path> [<depot_path>]

	          where <path_type> is a single keyword, <view_path> is a file
	          path with no leading slashes, and the optional <depot_path>
	          is a file path beginning with '//'.  Both <view_path> and
	          <depot_path> may contain trailing wildcards, but no leading
	          wildcards.  Embedded wildcards are restricted to the final
	          expression of the path, with no further slashes.
	          Lines in the Paths field may appear in any order.
	          A duplicated <view_path> overrides its preceding entry.

	          For example:

	              share   src/...
	              import  lib/abc/...  //over/there/abc/...
	              import  module2/*.txt //demo3/main/module2/*.txt
	              isolate bin/*
	              isolate bin/...dll

	          Default is:

	              share   ...

	          The <path_type> keyword must be one of:

	          share:  <view_path> will be included in client views and
	                  in branch views. Files in this path are accessible
	                  to workspaces, can be submitted to the stream, and
	                  can be integrated with the parent stream.

	          isolate: <view_path> will be included in client views but
	                   not in branch views. Files in this path are
	                   accessible to workspaces, can be submitted to the
	                   stream, but are not integratable with the parent
	                   stream.

	          import: <view_path> will be included in client views but
	                  not in branch views. Files in this path are mapped
	                  as in the parent stream's view (the default) or to
	                  <depot_path> (optional); they are accessible to
	                  workspaces, but can not be submitted or integrated
	                  to the stream.  If <depot_path> is used it may
	                  include a changelist or automatic label specifier;
	                  clients of that stream will be limited to seeing
	                  revisions at that point in time or lower within that
	                  depot path (See the explanation of 'ChangeView' in
	                  'p4 help client' for more details)

	          import+: <view_path> same as 'import' except that files can
	                   be submitted to the import path.  Note that an
	                   import+ path that references a path in a stream
	                   depot will not respect the views or flow rules of
	                   any other streams that depend on that depot path,
	                   so undesirable interactions are possible.

	          import&: <view_path> <depot_path> same as 'import' except
	                   that multiple import& paths can map the
	                   same <depot_path> to multiple <view_path>s.
	                   Files marked this way are readonly.
	                   <depot_path> is required.

	          exclude: <view_path> will be excluded from client views
	                   and branch views. Files in this path are not
	                   accessible to workspaces, and can't be submitted
	                   or integrated to the stream.

	          Paths are inherited by child stream views. A child stream's
	          paths can downgrade the inherited view, but not upgrade it.
	          (For instance, a child stream can downgrade a shared path to
	          an isolated path, but it can't upgrade an isolated path to a
	          shared path.) Note that <depot_path> is relevant only when
	          <path_type> is 'import'.

	Remapped: Optional; one or more lines that define how stream view paths
	          are to be remapped in client views.  Each line is of the
	          form:

	              <view_path_1> <view_path_2>

	          where <view_path_1> and <view_path_2> are Helix Core view
	          paths with no leading slashes, no leading wildcards, or
	          wildcards embedded between slashes:
	          For example:

	              ...    x/...
	              y/*    y/z/*

	          Line ordering in the Remapped field is significant; if more
	          than one line remaps the same files, the later line has
	          precedence.  Remapping is inherited by child stream client
	          views.

	Ignored: Optional; a list of file or directory names to be recursively
	         excluded in branch and client views. For example:

	             /tmp      # ignores files named 'tmp'
	             /tmp/...  # ignores dirs named 'tmp'
	             .tmp      # ignores file names ending in '.tmp'

	         Lines in the Ignored field may appear in any order.  Ignored
	         names are inherited by child stream client views.  Note that
	         due to their recursive nature, large numbers of Ignored
	         entries may be inefficient; consider P4IGNORE as another way
	         to prevent specific filename patterns from being added.

	The -d flag causes the stream spec to be deleted.  A stream spec may
	not be deleted if it is referenced by child streams or stream clients.
	Deleting a stream spec does not remove stream files, but it does mean
	changes can no longer be submitted to the stream's path.
	The stream spec is marked deleted while preserving its metadata.
	Report on deleted streams using 'p4 stream -o deletedStream@change',
	'p4 streams -a', and 'p4 streamlog deletedStream'.
	( See --obliterate. )

	The --obliterate flag deletes the stream from all metadata,
	removes the stream from pending and committed change lists, and allows
	deletion of such changelists. Obliterate can be restricted to
	a changelist: p4 stream --obliterate name@change.
	By default, --obliterate displays a preview of the
	results. To execute the operation, specify the -y flag.
	--obliterate requires 'admin' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	The -o flag causes the stream spec to be written to the standard
	output. The user's editor is not invoked. -v may be used with -o to
	expose the automatically generated client view for this stream.
	('p4 help branch' describes how to expose the branch view.)
	If an @changelist specifier is included with the stream name, the
	(submitted) stream as of that change is displayed rather than the
	latest (or open) version.

	The -P flag can be used to insert a value into the Parent field of a
	new stream spec. The flag has no effect on an existing spec.

	The -t flag is used to insert a value into the type field of a
	new stream spec and to adjust the default fromparent option
	for a new 'release' -type stream. The flag has no effect on an
	existing spec.

	The -i flag causes a stream spec to be read from the standard input.
	The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -f flag allows a user other than the owner to modify or delete a
	locked stream. It requires 'admin' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

    Operating on opened stream specs

	Stream specifications may be modified directly via the 'p4 stream',
	command, automatically and immediately updating all client views
	derived from that stream.  Alternatively, edits to the stream spec
	may be isolated to the editing client prior to being made available
	to other clients as part of an atomic changelist submission, in the
	same way that edits to files are made locally on a single client and
	then submitted to make them available to other clients.

	'p4 stream edit' puts the client's current stream spec into the
	'opened' state, isolating any edits made to fields that affect
	view generation.  While the spec is open, those fields are marked
	with the comment '#open' to indicate that they are open and isolated
	to your client.  Changes made to these fields will affect your client
	view normally, but other clients are not affected. 'p4 edit -So' has
	the same effect as 'p4 stream edit' (see 'p4 help edit').

	'p4 stream parentview' modifies the ParentView property of the client's
	current stream spec.  This property determines whether changes to the
	current stream's parent or ancestor affects client and branch views.

		-c	Associate the stream spec with given changelist#
			when opening the stream spec for edit.
		-n	Previews the changes made.
		-o	Display the changed stream spec.

			Change the ParentView field to 'inherit'. Changes to
			the Paths, Remapped, and Ignored fields which occurred

			ParentView will remain.  Client and branch views for
			streams with an inherit ParentView property will be
			affected by changes in an ancestor's Paths, Remapped,
			or Ignored fields.
		--noinherit
			Change the ParentView field to 'noinherit'.  Also
			converts the Paths, Remapped and Ignored fields by
			copy or merging paths from the corresponding fields in
			the ancestor stream specifications.  Client and branch
			views for streams with an inherit ParentView property
			will not be affected by changes in an ancestor's Paths,
			Remapped, or Ignored fields.
		--source-comments
			Add inline source comments to Paths, Remapped, or
			Ignored lines which were copied or merged from an
			ancestor stream spec when changing the ParentView field
			from inherit to noinherit.  The comment will
			specify the source ancestor spec, the change number for
			head version of the ancestor spec, and whether a given
			line was copied or merged into the target stream spec.

	'p4 stream parentview' may be used only with mainline, development, and
	release streams.

	The client's current stream spec must not be opened to use 'p4 stream
	parentview'.  The command will open the stream spec and change the
	ParentView field and possibly the Paths, Remapped, or Ignored fields.
	Any changes made to the stream spec will not be made public until the
	change is submitted.  Once submitted, the ParentView change will become
	part of the stream spec's integration history.

	'p4 stream convertsparse' converts a sparsedev or sparserel stream to
	either a development or release stream. If it is not already open, the
	stream specification will be opened and any unbranched files from the
	parent stream will be opened in the workspace for branch to the stream.
		-q	Suppress normal output messages. Messages regarding
			errors or exceptional conditions are displayed.

	'p4 stream resolve' resolves changes that have been submitted to the

	stream spec until newer changes have been resolved.
		-as	'Safe' resolve; skip fields that need merging.
		-am	Resolve by merging; skip fields with conflicts.
		-af	Force combination of text fields with conflicts.
		-at	Force acceptance of theirs; overwrites yours.
		-ay	Force acceptance of yours; ignores theirs.
		-n	Preview which fields require resolve.

	'p4 stream revert' reverts any pending changes made to the open spec,
	returning your client to the latest submitted version of the stream.
	'p4 revert -So' has the same effect as 'p4 stream revert' (see
	'p4 help revert').

	'p4 streamlog' lists the revision history of the specified streams
	in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent revision

	The open stream spec is included by default with any files that are

    Introduction to streams

	A Helix Core 'stream' is (generally) a branch of files.  Each stream
	has a parent stream and any number of child streams.  The backbone
	of a stream system is the mainline, a stream with no parent.

	A stream typically contains files that are branched from its parent
	stream. Work on files occurs in the context of a stream. As files are
	modified, changes can be integrated (i.e., merged or copied) between
	the stream and its parent.

	A child stream is either a 'development', 'release', 'task' or a
	'virtual' stream.  On a scale of stability, a development stream
	is considered lower than its parent, while a release stream is
	considered higher than its parent.  Change is expected to flow down
	by merging, and up by copying.  This "merge down, copy up" practice
	assures that merging is done only when necessary, and always in the
	more forgiving of the two streams involved.

	A stream is identified by its unique depot location.  A 'spec' defines
	the stream's location, its type, its parent stream, the files in its
	view, and other configurable behaviors.  A stream can be reparented
	by changing its spec.

	A stream's 'view' refers to both the client view and the branch view
	that are generated from the spec.  Generated client views are inserted
	automatically when a user creates a stream client.  Generated branch
	views are used automatically by commands that compare or integrate
	files.

	The stream view enables you to specify which files can be submitted
	to the stream and merged or copied from its parent stream.  A parent
	stream controls the scope of a child stream's view.  The stream view
	is inherited from the parent stream (except for mainline streams,
	which have no parent).  You can refine the view of a child stream to
	make it more restrictive than its parent, but you cannot change the
	view to make it less restrictive than the view of the parent.
	Virtual streams can be used to create alternative views of real
	streams.

	Virtual streams differ from other stream types in that a virtual
	stream is not a branch of files, but instead a filtered view of
	its parent stream. A virtual stream can have child streams, and its
	child streams inherit its views.

	Task streams are lightweight short-lived branches that are great for
	bug fixing or new features that only modify a small subset of the
	branch data. Since branched (copied) files are tracked in a set of
	shadow tables which are later removed, repository metadata is kept
	to a minimum when using this type of stream.  Note: only a client
	of the task stream will see the branched data, only modified data
	that is promoted becomes visible to users with access to the stream
	namespace.

	Streams are rooted in stream depots. A mainline and all of the streams
	related to it are rooted in the same stream depot. A Helix Core Server
	can host multiple stream depots. Although a stream depot can have
	multiple mainlines, one mainline per stream depot is recommended.

	Files can be submitted to streams only by stream clients. Each stream
	client is dedicated to a single stream.  A user may have several
	stream clients.  Stream clients can be switched from one stream to
	another. A client of a virtual stream is no different than a client
	of its underlying, real stream, except that it has a modified view
	of the underlying stream.

	To create a new mainline, first create a stream depot with 'p4 depot'.
	Then use 'p4 stream' to create a mainline stream rooted in that depot.
	To populate a new mainline, use 'p4 client' to create a client
	workspace for it. Then, in the client workspace, use 'p4 add' and 'p4
	submit' to upload files into the stream.

	To branch a stream into another, first use 'p4 stream' to create the
	new stream spec. Then use 'p4 copy' and 'p4 submit' to branch files
	into the new stream.  To merge files from one stream into another, use
	'p4 merge', 'p4 resolve', and 'p4 submit'. To promote files from one
	stream into another, use 'p4 copy' and 'p4 submit'.

	Several existing commands have been enhanced, and some new commands
	have been added, in support of streams:

	    branch       - Can expose a stream's branch view
	    client       - Can create or switch a stream client
	    clients      - Can list clients dedicated to a stream
	    copy         - Can use a stream view and enforce stream flow
	    depot        - Can create a stream depot
	    diff2        - Can use a stream view
	    dirs         - Can list dirs in a stream view
	    integrate    - Can use a stream view
	    interchanges - Can use a stream view
	    istat        - Checks/caches a stream's pending integration state
	    merge        - Can use a stream view and enforce stream flow
	    prune        - Remove unmodified branched files from a stream
	    stream       - Creates/edits a stream spec, can expose client view
	    streamlog    - List revision history of streams
	    streams      - Lists stream specs
	    streamspec   - Edit the stream template
	    switch       - Switch to a different stream or create a new stream

    streamspec -- Edit the stream template

    p4 streamspec

    p4 streamspec -i

	streamspec edits the template that specifies the format of streams.
	This format is used by 'p4 stream' when streams are entered or updated,
	and by 'p4 streams'.

	streamspec brings up a form with the following fields:

	   Fields:  A list of the fields maintained for each stream, one
		    line per field.  Each line has five words: code, name,
		    data-type, len, and field-type.

		    'code' is a unique integer identifier for storing
			the data of the field. When adding a new field,
			one may either enter a numeric field code value
			in the 701-749 range, or as 'NNN'. In the later
			case, the next available code value will be
			automatically generated. If the number of fields
			exhausts the range, new codes are assigned unique
			values greater than or equal to 10000.

		    'name' is the name of the field for the stream.

		    'data-type' indicates the format of the field:

			word: a single word (any value)
			date: a date/time field
			select: one of a set of words
			line: a one-liner
			text: a block of text

		    'len' is the recommended character length of a
			display box for the field.  If 0, a text box is
			assumed.

		    'field-type' indicates how to handle the setting of
			the field:

			optional: no default, and not required to be present
			default: default provided, still not required
			required: default provided, value must be present
			once: set once to the default and never changed
			always: always set to the default when saving the
				form

	   Values:  A list of 'select' fields and the values that the fields
		    can have.  Each line has two words: the field name and
		    the values list, with individual values separated by
		    '/' (no spaces).

	   Presets: A list of fields and their default values, for fields
		    whose 'setting' flag is other than 'optional'.  Each
		    line has two words: the field name and the default
		    value.  If the value has spaces, it must be enclosed
		    in double quotes.  The following special defaults are
		    recognized:

			$user: the user entering the stream
			$now: the current date
			$blank: the words '<enter description here>'

	   Openable: A list of versioning options when editing a stream spec.
		    Each line has two words: the field name and the value.
		    Values are:
		        'none' : may not be changed in a stream edit
		        'isolate' : may be changed only in a stream edit
		        'propagate' : may be changed in a stream edit or integ


	   Comments: text to be included at the top of each stream spec,
		    to help the user fill out the form. Each line must begin
		    with the comment character '#'.

	The following field codes are reserved:

	    code 701, required: the stream name
	    code 705, optional: the date of last modification
	    code 706, optional: the date of creation
	    code 704, optional: the user who created the stream
	    code 703, required: a short title which may be updated

	    code 708, required: one of mainline, release,
	        development(default), virtual, task
	    code 709, optional: a short description
	    code 707, optional:

	    code 712, optional: ignore a stream path in the resulting generated
	                        client view


	If you change the streamspec after streams have been created, note the
	following limitations:

	    Data is stored according to its code.  Fields can be renamed
	    by keeping the same code. Removing a code can cause the
	    associated data stored for the code to become abandoned.

	    Changing the definition of a code (for example, from 'text' to
	    'word') can require users to correct streams for the new format
	    during editing.

	The -o flag writes the stream template to the standard output.  The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a stream template from the standard input.  The
	user's editor is not invoked.

    Openable stream specs (Private editing of streams)

	Stream specifications can be edited using the command 'p4 stream'.
	By default, once the changes to the stream specification are saved,
	the changes take effect immediately, and can affect descendent streams
	as well.

	Such public changes can have far-reaching effects.  For example, if an
	import path is changed, a dependent build system may break unless
	corresponding file changes are made as well.

	As of the 2019.1 server release, stream specifications can be opened
	for edit in a client workspace, added to a changelist, shelved,
	unshelved, compared against the head version, and reverted.

	Private editing of stream specifications allows a user to modify a
	stream spec in isolation, group a stream spec change with associated
	file changes in one changelist, and shelve stream spec changes for
	review.

	The following commands have been modified to work with openable stream
	specifications:

    p4 change
    p4 copy
    p4 edit
    p4 describe
    p4 diff
    p4 diff2
    p4 integ
    p4 merge
    p4 opened
    p4 reopen
    p4 revert
    p4 shelve
    p4 stream resolve
    p4 streamlog
    p4 submit
    p4 unshelve

	'p4 change' specifications now allow an optional 'Stream:' field to
	add an opened stream spec to a pending changelist.  The stream spec
	must be opened to the current workspace prior to adding it to the
	changelist. (see 'p4 help change').

	'p4 edit -So' can be used with '-c changelist#' to open the client's
	stream spec for edit. (see 'p4 help edit').

	'p4 describe' of a changelist will list an affected stream spec before
	listing the affected files. (see 'p4 help describe').
	
	'p4 diff -As' can be used to diff an opened stream spec against either
	the head version of the stream spec (the default), or against the
	specified stream spec at either the head or the specified change number.
	To diff a shelved version of the specified stream spec, use the
	revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is the shelf
	changelist number. (see 'p4 help diff').

	'p4 diff2 -As' can be used to diff two different stream specifications.
	By default, the head version of a given stream spec is used.  If a
	changelist number is given, the stream spec version associated with
	the changelist will be used instead. If '@=change' is given, the
	shelved stream spec version associated with the changelist will be
	used instead. (see 'p4 help diff2').

	'p4 opened -So' can be used with '-c change' to list the stream spec
	that is currently opened for edit. By default, if -So is omitted,
	the opened stream spec will be listed before the list of files.
	If no stream spec is opened for edit, a stream spec will not be
	listed. (see 'p4 help opened').

	'p4 reopen -So' can be used with '-c change' to move the client's open
	stream spec to a different changelist.  'p4 reopen -Si [file ...]' can
	be used with a file list to include an open stream spec when also
	reopening files.  For example, to move an open stream spec to the
	default changelist, use 'p4 reopen -c default -So'. (see 'p4 help
	reopen').

	'p4 revert -So' can be used with '-c change' to revert the client's open
	stream spec.  'p4 revert -Si [file ...]' can be used with a file list to
	include an open stream spec when reverting files.   If a stream spec is
	open and neither -Si nor -So is specified, the stream spec will be
	excluded from the reversion. (see 'p4 help revert').

	'p4 shelve -c changelist# -As' specifies that only an opened stream
	specification should be shelved with the changelist.
	'p4 shelve -c changelist# -Af [file ...]' specifies that only files
	should be shelved with the changelist.  By default, if the stream spec
	is open and neither -Af nor -As is given, the stream specification will
	also be included with any shelved files. (see 'p4 help shelve').

	'p4 stream resolve' resolves opened stream spec fields.
	See 'p4 help streamcmds'.

	'p4 streamlog' lists the revision history of the specified streams
	in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent revision
	to the earliest.

	'p4 submit' can submit an opened stream specification. If the opened
	stream spec is in a numbered changelist in the current workspace, use
	'p4 submit -c changelist#' to submit the changelist.  If the opened
	stream spec is shelved to a numbered changelist, use
	'p4 submit -e shelf#' to submit the shelved changelist.

	The 'p4 submit' flags -So and -Sx can be used to control whether an open
	stream spec in the default changelist will be submitted.  Use -So with
	no file list to submit only the open stream spec in the default
	changelist.  Use -Sx with a file list to exclude the open stream spec
	when submitting files in the default changelist.  Use -Sx with no file
	list to submit all files without submitting the open stream spec.

	By default, if both 'p4 submit' flags -So and -Sx flags are omitted,
	then an open stream spec will be submitted along with any files in the
	given filelist. (see 'p4 help submit').

	'p4 unshelve -s changelist# -As' specifies that only the stream spec
	associated with the shelved numbered changelist should be unshelved to
	the current client. Unshelving a stream spec requires that the client is
	set to that stream, and will open the stream spec for edit. 
	'p4 unshelve -s changelist# -Af [file ...]' specifies that only files
	should be unshelved.  By default, the unshelve command acts on both
	the files (-Af) and the stream spec (-As). (see 'p4 help unshelve').

	'p4 copy -S stream' will copy the source stream spec propagatable
	fields into the target stream spec and the target stream spec will be
	opened for edit, along with stream files.  Use '-As' to copy the
	stream spec only, and '-Af' to copy files only.
	See 'p4 help streamspecinteg' for more details.

	'p4 integ -S stream' will integrate the source stream spec propagatable
	fields into the target stream spec and the target stream spec will be

    Integrating stream specs

	Stream specifications may be integrated from one stream to another.

	When a stream specification is integrated/merged/copied, any field in
	the source specification which has an Openable property value of
	'propagate' will be integrated/merged/copied to the target
	specification.  See 'p4 help streamspec' for more information about the
	stream specification properties.

    p4 copy [options] [-As | -Af] -S stream [-r] [-P parent] [file[revRange] ...]

    p4 merge [options] [-As | -Af] -S stream [-r] [-P parent] [file[revRange] ...]

	'p4 copy', 'p4 integrate', and 'p4 merge' now have options -Af and -As.

		-Af	Perform copy/integrate/merge with files only.
		-As	Perform copy/integrate/merge with stream specs only.	

	If neither -Af nor -As is given, the copy/integrate/merge is done with
	both files and stream specs, if applicable.

	If '-r' is not given, then the stream specification given with '-S' is
	the source specification, and the parent is the target.

	If '-r' is given, then the stream specification given with '-S' is
	the target specification, and the parent is the source.

	In order to integrate a stream specification, the current client must
	be set to the target stream.

	The copy/integrate/merge commands will open the target stream
	specification for integrate; this can be seen using 'p4 open'.

	'p4 stream resolve' must be used to merge stream specification fields.
	'p4 submit' commits integrated stream specifications to the depot.
	Unresolved stream specifications may not be submitted.  Integrations
	can be shelved with 'p4 shelve -As', unshelved with 'p4 unshelve -As',
	and abandoned with 'p4 revert -So'.

	When 'p4 integrate -As' schedules a stream specification to be resolved,
	the specification is read-only.  For other pre-submit changes,
	'p4 edit -So' must be used to make the specification writable.

	Use the configurable dm.integ.streamspec to enable/disable stream
	specification integration.  The configurable has 3 possible values:

	    0:  Stream spec integration is not allowed.
	    1:  Allow stream spec integration only for target streams with
	        noinherit ParentViews.  See 'p4 help streams' and 'p4 help
	        streamcmds' to read about the stream ParentView property.
	    2:  Allow stream spec integration for all streams.

	The default value for dm.integ.streamspec is 1.

    p4 istat [-As | -Af] [-a | -r] [-c | -C] [ -s ] stream

	'p4 istat' will report the combined integration status for both stream
	files and the stream spec of the specified stream.

	Use the -Af or -As option to limit the report of the status to only
	files or only the stream spec:

		-Af	Report integration status for stream files only.
		-As	Report integration status for the stream spec only.

	If the cache is cleared, the integration status for both files and
	stream spec are discovered, even if the requested report is only for
	files or only for the stream spec.

	The reporting and discovery of the stream status is dependent on the
	dm.integ.streamspec configurable:

	    0: Stream spec status is not discovered and not reported.
	    1: Stream spec status is discovered and reported only if the 
	       stream has a noinherit ParentView property.
	    2: Stream spec status is discovered and reported regardless of
	       the ParentView property value.

    p4 streamlog [ -c  changelist# -h -i -l -L -t -m max ] stream ...

	'p4 streamlog' lists the revision and integration history of the specified
	stream specs.  See 'p4 help streamlog' for more details.

	'p4 copy' copies one set of files (the 'source') into another (the
	'target').

	Using the client workspace as a staging area, 'p4 copy' makes the
	target identical to the source by branching, replacing, or deleting
	files.  'p4 submit' submits copied files to the depot. 'p4 revert'
	can be used to revert copied files instead of submitting them.  The
	history of copied files can be shown with 'p4 filelog' or 'p4
	integrated'.

	Target files that are already identical to the source, or that are
	outside of the client view, are not affected by 'p4 copy'. Opened,
	non-identical target files cause 'p4 copy' to exit with a warning.
	When 'p4 copy' creates or modifies files in the workspace, it leaves
	them read-only; 'p4 edit' can make them writable.  Files opened by
	'p4 copy' do not need to be resolved.

	Source and target files (fromFile and toFile) can be specified on
	the 'p4 copy' command line or through a branch view. On the command
	line, fromFile is the source file set and toFile is the target file
	set.  With a branch view, one or more toFile arguments can be given
	to limit the scope of the target file set.

	A revision specifier can be used to select the revision to copy; by
	default, the head revision is copied. The revision specifier can be
	used on fromFile, or on toFile, but not on both.  When used on toFile,
	it refers to source revisions, not to target revisions.  A range may
	not be used as a revision specifier.  For revision syntax, see 'p4
	help revisions'.

	The -S flag makes 'p4 copy' copy from a stream to its parent.
	Use -r with -S to reverse the copy direction.  Note that to submit
	copied stream files, the current client must be switched to the
	target stream, or to a virtual child stream of the target stream.
	The -S flag causes 'p4 copy' to use a generated branch view that
	maps the stream to its parent.  -P can be used to generate the
	branch view using a parent stream other than the stream's actual
	parent.  The -S flag also makes 'p4 copy' respect a stream's flow.
	By default, copying between streams requires the use of a stream view.

	The -F flag can be used to force copying against a stream's expected
	flow, or to use an arbitrarily specified view to copy into a stream.

	Stream specifications may also be copied along with stream files.
	Any field in the source specification which has an Openable property of
	'propagate' will be copied to the target specification. The -Af and
	-As flags control whether stream files or the stream spec is copied.

		-Af	Perform copy with files only.
		-As	Perform copy with the stream spec only.

	Both stream files and the stream spec will be copied if neither -Af
	nor -As is specified.  See 'p4 help streamspecinteg' for more details.

	The -b flag makes 'p4 copy' use a user-defined branch view.  (See
	'p4 help branch'.) The source is the left side of the branch view
	and the target is the right side. With -r, the direction is reversed.

	The -s flag can be used with -b to cause fromFile to be treated as
	the source, and both sides of the user-defined branch view to be
	treated as the target, per the branch view mapping.  Optional toFile
	arguments may be given to further restrict the scope of the target
	file set. -r is ignored when -s is used.

	The -c changelist# flag opens files in the designated (numbered)
	pending changelist instead of the default changelist.

	The -f flag forces the creation of extra revisions in order to
	explicitly record that files have been copied.  Deleted source files
	will be copied if they do not exist in the target, and files that are
	already identical will be copied if they are not connected by existing
	integration records.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion when updating ktext files on
	the client.

	The -n flag displays a preview of the copy, without actually doing
	anything.

	The -m flag limits the actions to the first 'max' number of files.

	The -q flag suppresses normal output messages. Messages regarding
	errors or exceptional conditions are displayed.

	The -v flag causes a 'virtual' copy that does not modify client
	workspace files.  After submitting a virtual integration, 'p4 sync'
	can be used to update the workspace.

	Type:        One of: 'local', 'stream', 'remote', 'spec', 'archive',
		     'unload', 'tangent', 'extension', 'graph', 'trait'.

		     A 'local' depot (the default) is managed directly by
		     the server and its files reside in the server's root
		     directory.

		     A 'stream' depot is a local depot dedicated to the
		     storage of files in a stream.

		     A 'remote' depot refers to files in another Helix Core
		     Server.

		     A 'spec' depot automatically archives all edited forms
		     (branch, change, client, depot, group, job, jobspec,
		     protect, triggers, typemap, and user) in special,
		     read-only files.  The files are named:
		     //depotname/formtype/name[suffix].  Updates to jobs made
		     by the 'p4 change', 'p4 fix', and 'p4 submit' commands
		     are also saved, but other automatic updates such as
		     as access times or opened files (for changes) are not.
		     A server can contain only one 'spec' depot.

		     An 'archive' depot defines a storage location to which
		     obsolete revisions may be relocated.

		     An 'unload' depot defines a storage location to which
		     database records may be unloaded and from which they
		     may be reloaded.

		     A 'tangent' depot defines a read-only location which
		     holds tangents created by the 'fetch -t' command. The
		     tangent depot named 'tangent' is automatically created
		     by 'fetch -t' if one does not already exist.

		     An 'extension' depot stores files related to Helix Core
		     Extensions.  See 'p4 help extension'.

		     A 'graph' depot defines a storage location to which
		     one or more git repositories are represented using
		     the git data model.

		     A 'trait' depot defines a storage location to which
		     huge traits may be stored. The storage location behavior
		     is determined by the 'p4 attribute' command or by the
		     setting of the 'trait.storedepot.min' configurable.
		     A server can contain only one 'trait' depot.
		     See 'p4 help attribute' and 'p4 help configurables'.
 
	Address:     For remote depots, the $P4PORT (connection address)
		     of the remote server.
		     For archive depots, this may be used to specify an S3
		     bucket as an alternative backing storage system.
		     See below.

	Suffix:      For spec depots, the optional suffix to be used
		     for generated paths. The default is '.p4s'.

	StreamDepth: For stream depots, the optional depth to be used
		     for stream paths in the depot, where depth equates
	             to the number of slashes following the depot name of a
	             stream.  This field is referenced when streams are
	             being created. The default is '1', matching the
	             traditional stream name.  This value may not be updated
	             once streams or archive data exist within the depot.

	Map:         Path translation information, in the form of a file
		     pattern with a single ... in it.  For local depots,
		     this path is relative to the server's root directory
		     or to server.depot.root if it has been configured
		     (Example: depot/...).  For remote depots, this path
		     refers to the remote server's namespace
		     (Example: //depot/...).

	SpecMap:     For spec depots, the optional description of which
	             specs should be saved, as one or more patterns.

	The -d flag deletes the specified depot.  If any files reside in the
	depot, they must be removed with 'p4 obliterate' before deleting the
	depot. If any archive files remain in the depot directory, they may
	be referenced by lazy copies in other depots; use 'p4 snap' to break
	those linkages. Snap lazy copies prior to obliterating the old depot
	files to allow the obliterate command to remove any unreferenced
	archives from the depot directory. If the depot directory is not
	empty, you must specify the -f flag to delete the depot.

	The -t flag is used to insert a value into the type field of a new
	depot spec.  This flag is ignored when used with existing depots.

	The -o flag writes the depot specification to standard output. The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a depot specification from standard input. The
	user's editor is not invoked.


	Storing the archives for a depot in S3 may be configured for archive
	depots by specifying the bucket configuration in the 'Address' field.
	The configuration must be provided in the form of ':' separated options
	and values on a single line, separated by commas (',') and preceded
	by 's3'. E.g:
	    Address: s3,bucket:mybucket,region:us-east-1

	The available options are:
	    - bucket    - The name of the bucket (required)
	    - url       - URL to the bucket
	                  (defaults to https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com)
	    - region    - The region the bucket resides in
	                  (optional depending on s3 implementation)
	    - accessKey - The S3 account's access key (required)
	    - secretKey - The S3 account's secret key (required)
	    - token     - The S3 account's session token
	                  (optional depending on bucket security)

	Note: Depending on several factors, including network latency and

	can be specified on the 'p4 diff2' command line or through a branch
	view.

	With a branch view, fromFile and toFile are optional; fromFile limits
	the scope of the source file set, and toFile limits the scope of the
	target. If only one file argument is given, it is assumed to be
	toFile.

	fromFile and toFile can include revision specifiers; by default, the

	'p4 diff2' precedes each diffed file pair with a header line of the
	following form:

	    ==== source#rev (type) - target#rev (type) ==== summary

	A source or target file shown as '<none>' means there is no file
	at the specified name or revision to pair with its counterpart.
	The summary status is one of the following: 'identical' means file
	contents and types are identical, 'types' means file contents are
	identical but the types are different, and 'content' means file
	contents are different.

	The -b flag makes 'p4 diff2' use a user-defined branch view.  (See
	'p4 help branch'.) The left side of the branch view is the source
	and the right side is the target.

	The -S flag makes 'p4 diff2' use a generated branch view that maps
	a stream (or its underlying real stream) to its parent.  This defaults
	to the current client's stream, if applicable.  -P can be used to
	generate the branch view using a parent stream other than the stream's
	actual parent.

	The -As flag can be used to diff two different stream specifications.
	By default, the head version of a given stream spec is used; if a
	change list number is given, the stream spec version associated with
	the changelist will be used instead. If '@=change' is given, the

	'p4 extension' manages the installation, versioning and configuration
	of Helix Core Server Extensions.

	For an introduction to Extensions, see 'p4 help serverextensionintro'
	and 'p4 help clientextensionintro'.  Further reference is available
	in the online documentation.

	Extensions are referred to by their Fully-Qualified Name ('extFQN').
	This is the combination of the Extension's namespace, name and optional
	depot file revision.  E.g. a namespace of 'ExampleInc' and name of
	'extName' would be referred to as 'ExampleInc::extName', or with
	a revision of '6', 'ExampleInc::extName#6'.

	By default, installation ( --install ) and deletion ( --delete ) of an
	extension displays a preview of the results. To execute the operation,
	you must also specify the --yes flag.

	The --sample flag creates a skeleton of a new Extension.  The argument
	is the name of the Extension to create as well as the name of the local
	directory where the files are placed.  The sample Extension has
	placeholder values that should be replaced when developing the code.

	The --package flag creates a packaged Extension file from the named
	directory of files, preparing it for --install on the server.  The
	resulting file has the same name as the directory, but with the
	'.p4-extension' suffix.  When used with the --sign flag, the files in
	the Extension package are cryptographically signed by the key pair in
	the directory specified with --sign (containing 'privatekey.txt' and
	'certificate.txt').  Signing adds two files to the Extension
	package:  a copy of the public key, renamed to '.p4-certificate.txt',
	and the signatures of the files in the Extension '.p4-signatures.json'.
	Packaging is done client-side and requires a version 2020.1 or newer
	command-line client.

	The --install flag is passed the full name of a packaged Extension file
	residing on the client and installs it server-side, where it can then
	be instantiated with --configure.  When --install is used with
	--cert, the fingerprint of the certificate pointed to with --install
	is stored and used to validate the signatures of signed Extensions
	prior to installation.  If signing enforcement is enabled on the
	server (via the 'server.extensions.allow.unsigned' configurable), the
	signing certificate must be installed prior to the Extension, via the
	'--install --cert' options.  The --comment flag goes with --cert to
	provide a short piece of text describing the certificate.

	The --configure flag is used to supply details about an Extension's
	configuration.  There are two parts to configuring an Extension - the
	'global' configuration, and the 'instance' configuration.  To create
	a global configuration, use --configure with the FQN of the Extension.
	Use --configure with --name together to create an instance
	configuration.  The --name flag takes the name of the configuration to
	create or modify.  More than one named instance is allowed for most
	event types that an Extension may be coded to work with (e.g. the
	'change-submit' event, but not 'auth-check').

	The --revision flag specifies which depot version of the Extension to
	configure.  The default is the head rev.  This flag applies to the
	--configure flag when used with or without the --name flag.

	The --list flag displays installed Extensions, configurations, and
	certificate fingerprints.  The value of the --type flag determines
	which data is reported.  Values for --type are: 'extensions', 'configs'
	(further narrowed by 'global' and 'instance'), and 'certs'.  Adding
	the --path flag filters instance configuration output to instances
	whose events are path-based and match the specified filespec.

	The --delete flag deletes an Extension, its configurations, or both.
	Passed the --name flag, just the named instance configuration will be
	removed.  Pass the --path flag to delete file-based instances by
	the part of the depot they affect.  When used without a --name,
	all revisions of an Extension and its configurations are removed,
	unless the --revision flag is used, in which case just the
	specific revision and instances using that revision are removed.
	When used with --cert, it deletes a trusted certificate.

	The --run flag is used to call an Extension-supplied command.  An
	Extension can implement its own end-user commands that behave similarly
	to native Helix Core commands in that they can have tagged output, send
	RPC-level messages, and open forms client-side.  They are restricted
	to reporting output and may not access client-side content.  The --run
	flag takes an instance configuration as its argument, and any other
	arguments are left to the Extension to interpret.

	This command requires 'super' access granted by 'p4 protect' unless
	the 'server.extensions.allow.admin' configurable is set to 1.  Users
	who are members of groups specified in the 'ExtAllowedGroups' field
	of an Extension's global configuration and who are either a depot
	or repo owner may create/configure instances of file-based Extensions
	to operate on the sections of the server they manage.

	Extensions do not run on metadata-only replicas.

    Introduction to Helix Core Client Extensions (Technical Preview)

	Client-side extensions are a means for customizing parts of
	Helix Core clients with user-supplied logic.

	Helix Core clients run Extensions natively without relying on
	external processes, providing a portable runtime and versioned
	programmatic API.  Extensions are written in the Lua language,
	version 5.3.  There are two types of client-side Extension:
	loose Extensions and packaged Extensions.  A loose Extension
	is a bare script source file, and a packaged Extension is a
	package of content - a manifest, source code, assets, etc all
	packaged up in a '.p4-extension' file.

	The P4EXTENSIONS environmental variable enables client-side
	Extensions.  The value of this variable specifies a file
	pattern the client program uses when searching the client
	filesystem for Extensions.  When executing a command, the
	client program load the P4EXTENSIONS variable, and like
	P4CONFIG, uses the current working directory as its starting
	point and moves its way to the root of the tree in search of
	file matches, keeping any that it encounters.  Unlike
	P4CONFIG, P4EXTENSIONS does not specify a literal file name.
	To leave room in the future for the existence of multiple
	scripting options, P4EXTENSIONS only specifies a filename
	prefix.  Of files that match the prefix, there must be a
	matching suffix in the form of '.version.language'.  E.g. if
	P4EXTENSIONS is set to 'p4script', a matching file would be
	named 'p4script-example.53.lua', where the '53' is the '5.3'
	of the bundled version of Lua.  Currently the only supported
	script type is 'lua' (case-sensitive) and the version is '53'.
	These two fields in the file name are to give the client a
	hint about what interpreter to load when running the loose
	Extension since they don't have a manifest file to declare
	those details.  P4EXTENSIONS may point to an absolute path, in
	which case the client does not search outside of the specified
	directory.

	Client-side Extensions can be disabled either by removing the
	P4EXTENSIONS variable from the environment, or by using the
	--no-script global flag.

	Client-side Extensions are run before and after command
	execution (pre/post hooks).

	Certain commands can not be handled with Extensions.  E.g. 'p4 trust'
	and 'p4 transmit'.

	The --script flag runs the named script file and exits.  The
	script is not an Extension here, but rather just a normal
	program being run for its side effects.

	Refer to the online documentation for instructions on creating
	Extensions.  Server-side Extensions are largely the same, but
	have additional APIs.  Note that for client-side Extensions,
	that the server-side help may not reflect client program
	capabilities if the versions don't match.

    Introduction to Helix Core Server Extensions

	Extensions are a means for customizing parts of the Helix Core with

	Extensions are self-contained packages of third-party code and assets
	run within the Helix Core Server, used for change submission
	validation, form validation, external authentication, external job
	fix integration, external archive integration, and command policies.
	See the list of trigger types in 'p4 help triggers' for a list of
	events that Extensions may register for.

	The Helix Core Server runs Extensions natively, without relying on
	external processes, so it can provide a portable, versioned runtime
	with automatic replication and a programmatic API.

	Extensions coexist with 'p4 triggers', but offer more functionality.

	The 'p4 extension' command manages the installation and configuration
	of extensions.  See 'p4 help extension'.

	Extensions are versioned within the Helix Core Server and are stored in
	a special 'extension' depot, named '.p4-extensions' by default.  The
	extension depot is only accessible to the super user and by read-only
	commands.  The extension depot is created automatically.  Installing
	or upgrading an Extension creates a changelist with information about
	pre/post install versions.  Multiple revisions of an Extension may be
	active at any given time and may be referenced by their revision
	number.

	An Extension is not active until it has been configured.  An Extension
	may have multiple configurations, depending on the events it registers

	The '-v' argument specifies the window of time, in seconds,

	the new master server. By default, the 'p4 failback' command verifies
	the file content that was updated during the 300 seconds prior to the
	failback. The command does not wait for this amount of time; it only
	waits as long as it takes to verify the file content that was
	updated during this window of time prior to the failback.

	The '-w' argument specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that
	the 'p4 failback' command waits for existing commands running on the
	master server to complete before stalling any remaining commands and
	then continuing with the failback. By default, the command waits
	for 60 seconds.

	original standby to its role prior to failover. This is a process
	that involves a few steps that are outlined here.

	The original 'p4 failover' command must be performed with
	master participation. Both the master and the standby servers
	must be running at server version 22.1 or above. Please refer
	to 'p4 help failover' for details regarding this command.

	In order to run 'p4 failback', the original master server prior
	to failover must be converted to a standby that will be the target
	of the later 'p4 failback'. This conversion is done via the
	'p4d -Fm' command:

	    p4d -r <p4root> -Fm [-y] <masterServerID> <standbyServerID>

	where <masterServerID> and <standbyServerID> refer to the server IDs
	of the master and standby prior to failover. The <p4root> location
	must be the P4ROOT location of the original master server. The '-y'
	option executes the command. Without '-y', this command runs in
	preview mode. The 'p4d -Fm' command prepares the server for later
	running 'p4 failback' by changing this server to become a
	restricted standby. The restricted status allows the standby to ignore
	configuration settings that would interfere with its operation as the
	target of the later 'p4 failback'.

	After this server is started and its replication has caught up
	with the master, the standby server spec can optionally be changed
	to make it a mandatory standby.

	The next step is to run 'p4 failback' from this restricted
	standby server. Please refer to 'p4 help failback' for details
	regarding this command.

	When the original master has been restored to master status
	via 'p4 failback', the original standby can then be restored
	to become the standby for the master. This procedure is done via
	the 'p4d -Fs' command:

	    p4d -r <p4root> -Fs [-y] <masterServerID> <standbyServerID>

	where <masterServerID> and <standbyServerID> refer to the server IDs
	of the master and standby prior to failover. The <p4root> location
	must be the P4ROOT location of the original standby server. The '-y'
	option executes the command. Without '-y', this command runs in
	preview mode. The 'p4d -Fs' command changes the server at that
	location to become a restricted standby. When this server discovers
	via replication that 'p4 failback' has been successfully run, it will
	function as an unrestricted standby for the restored master. After
	replication has caught up to the master, the server spec can
	optionally be changed to make it a mandatory standby.

    failover -- Fail over to a standby server

    p4 failover [ -y ] [ -m | [ -i ] [ -s <server ID> ] ] [ -w <quiesce wait> ]
                [ -v <verification time> ] [ <failover message> ]

	Fail over to a standby server from the server that the standby
	server is journalcopy'ing. The standby server can be a server with
	either 'standby' or 'forwarding-standby' services. The server from
	which failover can occur is any server from which a standby server
	can journalcopy, such as a server with 'standard', 'commit-server',
	or 'edge-server' services. (In the context of failover, the server
	from which failover can occur is often referred to as the "master"
	server, though that server could be a server with 'edge-server'
	services.) The 'p4 failover' command must be run on a
	standby server.

	A significant factor in determining the steps executed by
	the 'p4 failover' command is whether or not the master server
	participates in the failover. The master server participates in the
	failover if it is accessible, unless the '-i' flag (ignore the master
	server) is specified. (If the master server is ignored yet still
	accessible, an undesirable "split brain scenario" could result;
	see the description of the '-i' flag below.) If the master server
	participates in the failover, the standby server coordinates with
	the master server to perform an orderly failover. This includes the
	orderly disabling of master server usage, waiting for the journalcopy
	of the remaining transactions from the master server to the standby
	server, and the standby server stopping the master server. Note that
	the master's server version must be at least 2018.2 to participate
	in its failover.

	If the master server does not participate in the failover, a check
	is made to ensure that the standby server to which failover is to
	occur has the "mandatory" option set. Without the participation
	of the master server, failing over to a mandatory standby server
	is required to ensure that the other replicas remain consistent
	with the new master server after failover. Consistency is assured
	since during production operations, metadata must be journalcopy'd by
	all mandatory standby servers before that metadata is replicated to
	the other replicas. (Since journalcopy performance of the mandatory
	standby servers can affect the production replication to the other
	replicas, deploying one or more mandatory standby servers local
	to the master server is recommended for high availability. On
	the other hand, setting the "mandatory" option on a standby server
	at a remote disaster recovery site is generally not recommended.)

	Monitoring (p4 monitor) must be enabled when the standby server
	was started prior to running the 'p4 failover' command. The standby
	server must be appropriately licensed for its new role following
	the failover.

	Following a successful failover, site-specific changes might
	be needed to use the new master server. For example, it might
	be necessary to make DNS changes so that users and replicas
	can connect to the new master server. And if any 'standby'
	or 'forwarding-standby' servers across the entire installation
	do not have a value for the 'ReplicatingFrom' field in their
	server spec, the 'statefailover' file in the 'P4ROOT' of the
	new master server should be deleted, but only after the standby
	servers journalcopy'ing from the new master server have made their
	initial journalcopy request after the failover. (The deletion
	of the 'statefailover' file will occur automatically if the
	'ReplicatingFrom' field is defined for all 'standby' and
	'forwarding-standby' servers across the entire installation.)
	The former master server cannot restart until its server ID
	is reset via 'p4d -xD', and will require additional configuration
	to make it a standby server.

	If the 'p4 failover' command is interrupted or an error is
	encountered during the failover, the command will attempt to undo,
	to the extent practical, what was done prior to the interruption or
	error. For example, if after starting to refuse new commands on the
	master server, the 'p4 failover' command is interrupted during the
	wait to allow existing commands on the master server to complete,
	then new commands will again be allowed on the master server. But
	if an error is encountered after the standby server has stopped
	the master server, the standby server will not restart the
	master server.

	The '-i' flag ignores the master server during failover. Only the
	accessibility of the master server is checked; there is no other
	participation of the master server in the failover. If the master
	server is ignored yet still accessible, failing over to a standby
	server could result in the undesirable configuration of two master
	servers, each processing divergent datasets. (This configuration
	is sometimes referred to as a "split brain scenario".) If the
	master server is still accessible, a message warning of the
	potentially undesirable configuration is reported.

	The '-m' flag requires that the master server must participate in
	the failover. If the master server cannot be accessed by the standby
	server, the failover will not occur.

	The '-s' argument specifies the master's server ID that is used if
	the master server cannot be accessed by the standby server.
	If '-s' is not specified for this scenario and this standby server
	is mandatory, the value of the ReplicatingFrom server spec field
	will be used for the master's server ID.

	The '-v' argument specifies the window of time, in seconds,
	during which classic depot file content that was updated prior to
	the failover will be verified to ensure that it will be correct on
	the new master server. By default, the 'p4 failover' command verifies
	the file content that was updated during the 300 seconds prior to the
	failover. The command does not wait for this amount of time; it only
	waits as long as it takes to verify the file content that was
	updated during this window of time prior to the failover.

	The '-w' argument specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that
	the 'p4 failover' command waits for existing commands running on the
	master server to complete before stalling any remaining commands and
	then continuing with the failover. By default, the command waits
	for 60 seconds.

	The '-y' flag actually executes the failover. By default, the
	'p4 failover' command only checks that a failover might be possible.

	The <failover message> is returned when attempting to start a new
	command on the master server once the failover process has actually
	started. A default message is used if the <failover message> is not
	specified. The <failover message> must be the last argument specified
	in the 'p4 failover' command; no other arguments should be specified
	after the <failover message>. The <failover message> need not be
	enclosed in quotes.

	'p4 failover' requires 'super' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	The -A <pattern> flag restricts displayed attributes to those that
	match 'pattern'.

	The -F flag lists only files satisfying the filter expression. This
	filter syntax is similar to the one used for 'jobs -e jobview' and is
	used to evaluate the contents of the fields in the preceding list.
	Filtering is case-sensitive.

	        Example: -Ol -F "fileSize > 1000000 & headType=text"

	Note: filtering is not optimized with indexes for performance.

	The -L flag can be used with multiple file arguments that are in
	full depot syntax and include a valid revision number. When this
	flag is used the arguments are processed together by building an
	internal table similar to a label. This file list processing is
	significantly faster than having to call the internal query engine
	for each individual file argument. However, the file argument syntax
	is strict and the command will not run if an error is encountered.

	The -T fields flag returns only the specified fields. The field names
	can be specified using a comma- or space-delimited list.

	        Example: -Ol -T "depotFile, fileSize"

	The -m max flag limits output to the specified number of files.

	The -r flag sorts the output in reverse order.

	The -c changelist# flag displays files modified by the specified
	changelist or after that changelist was submitted.  This operation is
	much faster than using a revision range on the affected files.

	The -e changelist# flag lists files modified by the specified
	changelist. When used with the -Ro flag, only pending changes are
	considered, to ensure that files opened for add are included. This
	option also displays the change description.

	The -O options modify the output as follows:

	        -Oa     output attributes set by 'p4 attribute'

		-Ob	output the path, revision, type, full and relative
			local paths of the server archive file. Requires
			'admin' privilege.

	        -Od     output the digest of the attribute

	        -On     output attribute value storage locations rather than
	                the attribute values

	        -Oe     output attribute values encoded as hex

	        -Of     output all revisions for the given files (this
	                option suppresses other* and resolve* fields)

	        -Ol     output a fileSize and digest field for each revision
	                (this may be expensive to compute)

	        -Om     include other ditto mapped client files in output

	        -Op     output the local file path in both Helix Core syntax
	                (//client/) as 'clientFile' and host form as 'path'

	        -Or     output pending integration record information for
	                files opened on the current client, or if used with
	                '-e <change> -Rs', on the shelved change

	        -Os     exclude client-related data from output

	        -OL     when run against an edge server, output global lock
	                information from the commit server

	The -R option limits output to specific files:

	        -Rc     files mapped in the client view
	        -Rh     files synced to the client workspace
	        -Rn     files opened not at the head revision
	        -Ro     files opened
	        -Rr     files opened that have been resolved
	        -Rs     files shelved (requires -e)
	        -Ru     files opened that need resolving

	The -S option changes the order of output:

	        -Sd     sort by date
	        -Sh     sort by have revision
	        -Sr     sort by head revision
	        -Ss     sort by filesize
	        -St     sort by filetype

	Note that sorting is applied to all potential results matching
	the file argument(s), and the totalFileCount field indicates
	the number of results before the -m option is applied.

	The -U flag displays information about unload files in the unload
	depot (see 'p4 help unload').

	For compatibility, the following flags are also supported:
	-C (-Rc) -H (-Rh) -W (-Ro) -P (-Op) -l (-Ol) -s (-Os).

	The --streamviews option reports results for streams in the context
	of the stream.

	Searches files for lines that match the specified regular expression,
	which can contain wildcards.  The parser used by the Helix Core Server
	is based on V8 regexp and might not be compatible with later parsers,
	but the majority of functionality is available.

	By default the head revision is searched.  If the file argument
	includes a revision specification, all corresponding revisions are
	searched.  If the file argument includes a revision range, only files
	in that range are listed, and the highest revision in the range is
	searched.  For details about revision specifiers, see
	'p4 help revisions'.

	The -a flag searches all revisions within the specified range. By
	default only the highest revision in the range is searched.

	The -i flag causes the pattern matching to be case-insensitive. By
	default, matching is case-sensitive.

	The -n flag displays the matching line number after the file revision
	number. By default, matches are displayed as revision#: <text>.

	The -v flag displays files with non-matching lines.

	The -F flag is used to interpret the pattern as a fixed string.

	The -G flag is used to interpret the pattern as a regular expression,
	which is the default behavior.

	The -L flag displays the name of each selected file from which no
	output would normally have been displayed. Scanning stops on the
	first match.

	The -l flag displays the name of each selected file containing
	matching text. Scanning stops on the first match.

	The -s flag suppresses error messages that result from abandoning
	files that have a maximum number of characters in a single line that
	are greater than 4096.  By default, an error is reported when grep
	abandons such files.

	The -t flag searches binary files.  By default, only text files are
	searched.

	The -A <num> flag displays the specified number of lines of trailing
	context after matching lines.

	The -B <num> flag displays the specified number of lines of leading
	context before matching lines.

	The -C <num> flag displays the specified number of lines of output
	context.

	Regular expressions:

	A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by `|'. It
	matches anything that matches one of the branches.

	A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match
	for the first, followed by a match for the second, etc.

	A piece is an atom possibly followed by `*', `+', or `?'.  An atom
	followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.
	An atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of
	the atom.  An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or
	the null string.

	An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for
	the regular expression),  a range (see below),  `.'  (matching any
	single character),  `^' (matching the null string at the beginning
	of the input string),  `$' (matching the null string at the end of
	the input string),  a `\' followed by a single character (matching
	that character),  or a single character with no other significance
	(matching that character).

	A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'.  It normally
	matches any single character from the sequence.  If the sequence
	begins with `^',  it matches any single character not from the rest
	of the sequence.  If two characters in the sequence are separated by
	`-', this is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between
	them (e.g. `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit).  To include a literal
	`]' in the sequence, make it the first character (following a possible
	`^').  To include a literal `-', make it the first or last character.

	The symbols '\<' and '\>' respectively match the empty string at
	the beginning and end of a word.

    p4 group -i [-a|-A]

	Create a group or modify the membership of an existing group.
	A group can contain users and other groups. The group specification
	is put into a temporary file and the editor (configured by the
	environment variable $P4EDITOR) is invoked.

	A group exists when it has any users or other groups in it, and
	ceases to exist if all users and groups in it are removed.

	Each group has MaxResults, MaxScanRows, MaxLockTime, MaxOpenFiles
	and MaxMemory fields, which limit the resources committed to
	operations performed by members of the group.  See
	'p4 help maxresults' for more information on MaxResults, MaxScanRows,
	MaxLockTime, MaxOpenFiles and MaxMemory.

	Since a user may be a member of multiple groups, the effective
	resource limits for that user take into account the resource limits
	specified by each group to which that user belongs, except for those
	groups where the limit is specified as 'unset'.

	After examining all relevant groups, an individual user's limit is
	the highest of any group with a limit to which they belong, unlimited
	if any of their groups has 'unlimited' for that field, or unlimited
	if they belong to no group with a limit.

	Each group also has a Timeout field, which specifies how long (in
	seconds) a 'p4 login' ticket remains valid.  A value of 'unset' or
	'unlimited' is equivalent to no timeout. An individual's timeout is
	the highest of any group with a limit to which they belong, unlimited
	if any of their groups has 'unlimited' for the timeout value, or
	unlimited if they belong to no group with a limit. See 'p4 help login'
	for more information.

	Each group has a PasswordTimeout field, which determines how long a
	password remains valid for members of the group.

	A group may be synchronized with an LDAP group by setting the three
	fields: LdapConfig, LdapSearchQuery and LdapUserAttribute. This takes
	the LDAP configuration (see 'p4 ldap') specified by LdapConfig and uses
	it to execute the query stored by LdapSearchQuery. The LDAP attribute
	specified by LdapUserAttribute is taken to be user's username and is
	added to the group's user list.  If the group contains references its
	members by their DNs rather than by username, you may instruct the DN
	to be followed by setting the LdapUserDNAttribute field to the name of
	the group object's attribute that the DNs are stored in: the username
	will be found by looking for the LdapUserAttribute attribute in the
	object referred to by the DN.  At least one group owner must be set
	if these LDAP fields are used.  If the LDAP server requires login for
	read-only queries, then the LDAP configuration must contain valid bind
	credentials in the LDAP spec's SearchBindDN and SearchPasswd fields

	The -d flag deletes a group.

	The -o flag writes the group specification to standard output. The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a group specification from standard input. The
	user's editor is not invoked.  The new group specification replaces
	the previous one.

	The -a flag enables a user without 'super' access to modify the group
	if that user is an 'owner' of that group. Group owners	are specified
	in the 'Owners' field of the group spec.

	The -A flag enables a user with 'admin' access to add a new group.
	Existing groups may not be modified when this flag is used.

	The -F flag, used only with -d, forces the deletion of the
	specified group, and also removes the group from the protections
	table and from all groups.

	All commands that require access granted by 'p4 protect' consider a
	user's groups when calculating access levels.

	another (the 'target').

	(See also 'p4 merge' and 'p4 copy', variants of 'p4 integrate' that
	may be easier and more effective for the task at hand.)

	Using the client workspace as a staging area, 'p4 integrate' adds and
	deletes target files per changes in the source, and schedules all
	other affected target files to be resolved.  Target files outside of
	the current client view are not affected. Source files need not be
	within the client view.

	'p4 resolve' must be used to merge file content, and to resolve
	filename and filetype changes. 'p4 submit' commits integrated files
	to the depot.  Unresolved files may not be submitted.  Integrations
	can be shelved with 'p4 shelve' and abandoned with 'p4 revert'.  The
	commands 'p4 integrated' and 'p4 filelog' display integration history.

	When 'p4 integrate' schedules a workspace file to be resolved, it
	leaves it read-only. 'p4 resolve' can operate on a read-only file.
	For other pre-submit changes, 'p4 edit' must be used to make the
	file writable.

	Source and target files can be specified either on the 'p4 integrate'
	command line or through a branch view. On the command line, fromFile
	is the source file set and toFile is the target file set.  With a
	branch view, one or more toFile arguments can be given to limit the
	scope of the target file set.

	revRange is a revision or a revision range that limits the span of
	source history to be probed for unintegrated revisions.  revRange
	can be used on fromFile, or on toFile, but not on both.  When used on
	toFile, it refers to source revisions, not to target revisions.  For
	details about revision specifiers, see 'p4 help revisions'.

	The -S flag makes 'p4 integrate' use a generated branch view that maps
	a stream (or its underlying real stream) to its parent.  With -r, the
	direction of the mapping is reversed.  -P can be used to generate the
	branch view using a parent stream other than the stream's actual
	parent.  Note that to submit integrated stream files, the current
	client must be switched to the target stream, or to a virtual child
	stream of the target stream.  By default, integration between streams
	requires the use of a stream view.

	Stream specifications may also be integrated along with stream files.
	Any field in the source specification which has an Openable property of
	'propagate' will be integrated to the target specification. The -Af and
	-As flags control whether stream files or the stream spec is
	integrated.

		-Af	Perform integration with files only.
		-As	Perform integration with stream specs only.

	Both stream files and the stream spec will be integrated if neither -Af
	nor -As is specified.  See 'p4 help streamspecinteg' for more details.

	The -b flag makes 'p4 integrate' use a user-defined branch view.
	(See 'p4 help branch'.) The source is the left side of the branch view
	and the target is the right side. With -r, the direction is reversed.

	The -s flag can be used with -b to cause fromFile to be treated as
	the source, and both sides of the branch view to be treated as the
	target, per the branch view mapping.  Optional toFile arguments may
	be given to further restrict the scope of the target file set.  The
	-r flag is ignored when -s is used.

	Note that 'p4 integrate' automatically adusts source-to-target
	mappings for moved and renamed files.  (Adjustment occurs only if
	the 'p4 move' command was used to move/rename files.) The scope of
	source and target file sets must include both the old-named and the
	new-named files for mappings to be adjusted.  A filename resolve is
	scheduled for each remapped file to allow the target to be moved to
	match the source.

	The -f flag forces integrate to ignore integration history and treat
	all source revisions as unintegrated. It is meant to be used with
	revRange to force reintegration of specific, previously integrated
	revisions.

	The -O flags cause more information to be output for each file opened:

		-Ob	Show the base revision for the merge (if any).
		-Or	Show the resolve(s) that are being scheduled.

	The -R flags modify the way resolves are scheduled:

		-Rb	Schedules 'branch resolves' instead of branching new
			target files automatically.

		-Rd	Schedules 'delete resolves' instead of deleting
			target files automatically.

		-Rs	Skips cherry-picked revisions already integrated.
			This can improve merge results, but can also cause
			multiple resolves per file to be scheduled.

	The -Di flag modifies the way deleted revisions are treated.  If the
	source file has been deleted and re-added, revisions that precede
	the deletion will be considered to be part of the same source file.
	By default, re-added files are considered to be unrelated to the
	files of the same name that preceded them. When the source file has
	been moved or renamed, the move/add and move/delete revisions are
	propagated as branch and delete revisions.

	The -F flag permits integration between streams with an arbitrarily
	specified view.  By default, a stream view must be used to integrate
	between two streams.

	The -h flag leaves the target files at the revision currently synced
	to the client (the '#have' revision). By default, target files are
	automatically synced to the head revision by 'p4 integrate'.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion when updating ktext files on
	the client.

	The -m flag limits integration to the first 'max' number of files.

	The -n flag displays a preview of integration, without actually
	doing anything.

	The -q flag suppresses normal output messages. Messages regarding
	errors or exceptional conditions are displayed.

	If -c changelist# is specified, the files are opened in the
	designated numbered pending changelist instead of the 'default'
	changelist.

	The -v flag causes a 'virtual' integration that does not modify
	client workspace files unless target files need to be resolved.
	After submitting a virtual integration, 'p4 sync' can be used to
	update the workspace.

	and its fromParent/toParent flow options. (See 'p4 help stream'.)

	The -r flag shows the status of integration to the stream from its
	parent. By default, status of integration in the other direction is
	shown, from the stream to its parent.

	The -a flag shows status of integration in both directions.

	The -c flag forces 'p4 istat' to assume the cache is stale; it
	causes a search for pending integrations.  Use of this flag can
	impact server performance. The -C flag performs the same actions,
	and additionally clears the stream's record of the highest merged
	changelist.

	The -s flag shows cached state without refreshing stale data.

	'p4 istat' will report the combined integration status for both stream
	files and the stream spec of the specified stream.

	Use -Af or -As flag to limit the report of the status of files only or
	the stream spec only:

		-Af	Report integration status for stream files only.
		-As	Report integration status for the stream spec only.

	If the cache is cleared, the integration status for both files and
	stream spec are discovered, even if the requested report is only for
	files or only for the stream spec.

	Jobspec edits the template that specifies the format of jobs.
	This format is used by 'p4 job' when jobs are entered or updated,
	and by 'p4 jobs' and 'p4 describe' when jobs are displayed.

	Jobspec brings up a form with the following fields:

	   Fields:  A list of the fields maintained for each job, one
		    line per field.  Each line has five words: code, name,
		    data-type, len, and field-type.

		    'code' is a unique integer identifier for storing
			the data of the field. When adding a new field,
			one may either enter a numeric field code value
			in the 101-199 range, or as 'NNN'. In the later
			case, the next available code value will be
			automatically generated. If the number of fields
			exhausts the range, new codes are assigned unique
			values greater than or equal to 10000.

		    'name' is the name of the field for the job.

		    'data-type' indicates the format of the field:

			word: a single word (any value)
			date: a date/time field
			select: one of a set of words
			line: a one-liner
			text: a block of text
			bulk: text not indexed for 'p4 jobs -e'

		    'len' is the recommended character length of a
			display box for the field.  If 0, a text box is
			assumed.

		    'field-type' indicates how to handle the setting of
			the field:

			optional: no default, and not required to be present
			default: default provided, still not required
			required: default provided, value must be present
			once: set once to the default and never changed
			always: always set to the default when saving the
				form, adding or deleting fixes with 'p4 fix'
				or 'p4 changelist', or submitting a change
				associated with the job with 'p4 submit'.

	   Values:  A list of 'select' fields and the values that the fields
		    can have.  Each line has two words: the field name and
		    the values list, with individual values separated by
		    '/' (no spaces).

	   Presets: A list of fields and their default values, for fields
		    whose 'setting' flag is other than 'optional'.  Each
		    line has two words: the field name and the default
		    value.  If the value has spaces, it must be enclosed
		    in double quotes.  The following special defaults are
		    recognized:

			$user: the user entering the job
			$now: the current date
			$blank: the words '<enter description here>'

		    The Preset for the job status field (code 102) has
		    a special syntax for providing a default fix status
		    for 'p4 fix' and 'p4 change' along with the default
		    status for new jobs:

		    	jobStatus,fix/fixStatus

		    Otherwise the fixStatus is hardwired to 'closed'.

	   Comments: text to be included at the top of each job specification,
		    to help the user fill out the form. Each line must begin
		    with the comment character '#'.

	The following field codes are reserved:

	    code 101, required: the job name
	    code 102, optional: the job status
	    code 103, optional: the user who created the job
	    code 104, optional: the date the job was created
	    code 105, optional: the description

	    If there is a job status field (102), 'p4 fix' and 'p4 change'
	    (of a submitted changelist) and 'p4 submit' (of a pending
	    changelist) will set the job's status to the fix's status for
	    each job associated with the change.  If the fix's status is
	    the special value 'same', the job's status is left unchanged.

	    Fields 102-105 are used by 'p4 describe' and 'p4 jobs' to display
	    a job summary.  Missing fields are omitted from the summary.

	    If field 105 is present, it is treated as a description,
	    which is used by 'p4 change' and 'p4 submit' to annotate the
	    list of jobs to be fixed by the changelist being created.

	If you change the jobspec after jobs have been created, note the
	following limitations:

	    Data is stored according to its code.  Fields can be renamed
	    by keeping the same code. Removing a code can cause the
	    associated data stored for the code to become abandoned.

	    Changing the definition of a code (for example, from 'text' to
	    'word') can require users to correct jobs for the new format
	    during editing.

	The -o flag writes the job template to the standard output.  The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads a job template from the standard input.  The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	'p4 jobspec' requires 'admin' access, which is granted by 'p4 protect'.

	                          should be stored in the unload depot.

	Revision:    An optional revision specification for an automatic
		     label.  Enclose in double quotes if it contains the
		     # (form comment) character.  An automatic label can
		     be treated as a pure alias of a single revision
		     specification (excluding @label) provided that the
		     View mapping is empty.

	View:        A mapping that selects files from the depot. The
		     default view selects all depot files. Only the left
		     side of the mapping is used for labels.  Leave this
		     field blank when creating an automatic label as
		     a pure alias. See 'p4 help views'.

	ServerID:    If set, restricts usage to the named server.
		     If unset, usage is allowed on any server.

	A label is a named collection of revisions. A label is either
	automatic or static. An automatic label refers to the revisions
	given in the View: and Revision: fields. When using automatic labels
	containing both View: and Revision: fields, use of the automatic labels
	to represent revision ranges might not produce the same results when
	using the equivalent changelist revision range. To make an automatic
	label behave exactly like its revision specifier, leave the View: field
	blank. Without this field, the automatic label is considered a pure
	alias and is processed exactly like the revision specification. A
	static label refers to the revisions that are associated with the label
	using the 'p4 tag' or 'p4 labelsync' commands. A static label cannot
	have a Revision: field. See 'p4 help revisions' for information on
	using labels as revision specifiers.

	Only the label owner can run 'p4 labelsync', and only if the label
	is unlocked. A label without an owner can be labelsync'd by any user.

	Flag -d deletes the specified label. You cannot delete a locked label.
	The -f flag forces the delete.

	The -t flag copies the view and options from the template label to

	The -f flag forces the deletion of a label. By default, locked labels
	can only be deleted by their owner.  The -f flag also permits the
	Last Modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin' access,

	The -g flag should be used on an Edge Server to update a global

    p4 ldap config
    p4 ldap -d config
    p4 ldap -o config

	An LDAP configuration defines an Active Directory or other LDAP server
	to which the Helix Core Server can connect in order to authenticate
	users who have AuthMethod set to 'ldap'. In addition to the host and
	port of the LDAP server, this configuration defines how the
	authenticationshould happen, by picking one of three bind methods:

	Simple:
	This authentication method takes a template DN and substitutes %%user%%
	placeholders with the user's userId to produce the user's DN which the
	Helix Core Server will then attempt to bind against, validating the
	user's password. An example of such a template could look like this:

	    uid=%%user%%,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org

	Search:
	This authentication method uses an LDAP search query to locate the
	appropriate user record. It requires a known base DN for the search
	and an LDAP search query (which should make use of the %%user%%
	placeholder). It may also require the full DN and password of a known
	read-only entity in the directory in order to perform the search.
	An example base DN and LDAP query might look like this:

	    Base DN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=org
	    LDAP query: (uid=%%user%%)

	SASL:
	This authentication method defers the user search to the LDAP server
	and does not require a DN to be discovered before a bind is attempted.
	A specific realm may be provided if the LDAP server has multiple
	realms (or domains in the case of Active Directory). Additionally, if
	'realminusername' option is enabled, the realm will be separated from
	the username if that username is in either UNC (realm\user) or
	UPN (user@realm) formats.

	SASL is generally the easiest method to configure if the LDAP server
	supports SASL DIGEST-MD5.

	To enable LDAP authentication, one or more LDAP configurations must
	exist and be assigned a priority with the 'auth.ldap.order.N'
	configurable. The server will need to be restarted before LDAP
	authentication will be enabled. Note: LDAP authentication implies at
	least security level 3; all must use ticket based authentication (see
	'p4 login') and any users authenticating against the Helix Core
	database must have strong passwords.

	If more than one 'auth.ldap.order.N' configurable is set to a valid
	configuration, each one is considered enabled and a login by a user
	with AuthMethod set to ldap will cause each enabled configuration
	to be checked in order until the user's credentials are validated or
	the user record is found but the credentials are rejected.

	When LDAP authentication is enabled and the 'auth.default.method'
	configurable is set to 'ldap' and the 'auth.ldap.userautocreate'
	configureable is set to 1, any user who is able to authenticate will be
	created and will consume a license, regardless of whether they are
	granted access by 'p4 protect'. Setting this configurable to 2 will
	perform an additional check that the user would have protections before
	allowing the user to authenticate. If the 'getattrs' option is enabled,
	the new user's Fullname and Email fields will be populated from the
	user's record in the directory using the values in the LDAP attributes
	specified in the 'AttributeName' and 'AttributeEmail' fields. If the
	'BindMethod' is 'SASL', this feature also requires the 'SearchBaseDN'
	and 'SearchFilter' fields to be configured.

	In addition to the bind methods, user access can be restricted only to
	those who belong to a particular group within the directory. This is
	achieved by performing an LDAP search as the user who has just been
	authenticated, and checking that there is at least one record returned
	from that search. This search requires a base DN and a LDAP query that
	contains the %%user%% placeholder. An example base DN and LDAP query to
	check that the user is in a group named 'perforce' might look like:

	    Base DN: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org
	    LDAP query: (&(cn=perforce)(memberUid=%%user%%))


	The LDAP configuration spec contains the following fields:

	Name:          The LDAP configuration name.

	Host:          The FQDN of the directory server.

	Port:          The port number at which to connect to the directory
	               server.

	Encryption:    The encryption method to use when connecting to the
	               directory server. Options are: 'none', 'ssl' and 'tls'.

	BindMethod:    The bind method to use with this directory. Options
	               are: 'simple', 'search' and 'sasl'.

	Options:       Modifiers to the behavior of the LDAP integration,
	               specific to this configuration. Options are:
	                   [no]downcase - should 'p4 ldapsync' downcase
	                                  usernames from the directory.
	                   [no]getattrs - should the Fullname and Email fields
	                                  for users created by 'p4 login'
	                                  be populated from the directory.
	                   [no]realminusername - take the realm from the SASL
	                                         username if it is in UNC or
	                                         UPN format.

	SimplePattern: This is the DN which will be used to bind against to
	               validate the user's credentials. The %%user%% placeholder
	               will be replaced with the user's userId. This field
	               only applies to the 'simple' bind method.

	SearchBaseDN:  The DN from which to start the search for the user
	               object.

	SearchFilter:  The LDAP query filter to use to identify the user object
	               which will be used to bind against. The %%user%%
	               placeholder will be replaced with the user's userId.

	SearchScope:   The scope to use when searching for the user records.
	               Options are:
	                   baseonly - Just the BaseDN object
	                   children - The BaseDN and its direct children
	                   subtree - The BaseDN and all objects below it

	SearchBindDN:  The DN to bind against in order to search the directory.

	SearchPasswd:  The password for the BindDN record.

	SaslRealm:     The optional realm to use when authenticating the user
	               via SASL.This field applies only to the 'sasl' bind
	               method.

	GroupSearchFilter: The filter to use for the group search.

	GroupBaseDN:       The search base for performing the group search. If
	                   unset this will default to the SearchBaseDN.

	GroupSearchScope:  The scope to use when performing the group search.
	                   Options are:
	                       baseonly - Just the BaseDN object
	                       children - The BaseDN and its direct children
	                       subtree - The BaseDN and all objects below it

	AttributeUid:      The name of the attribute in the user object that
	                   contains the user's UID.

	AttributeName:     The name(s) of the attribute(s) in the user object
	                   that contains the user's full name. If multiple
	                   attributes are required to form the full name,
	                   specify each one surrounded by %% symbols such
	                   that expanding them forms the user's full name."

	AttributeEmail:    The name of the attribute in the directory's user
	                   object that contain the users' email addresses.


	The GroupSearchFilter field is only needed if users must also belong
	to a group within the directory. The other two group fields may also
	be used by the 'p4 ldapsync' command.


	The -d flag deletes the named LDAP configuration.

	The -o flag writes the LDAP configuration to standard output. The
	user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a LDAP configuration to be read from the standard
	input. The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -t flag specifies a username to attempt authentication against
	the named LDAP configuration. This will return a success message or an
	error message that will contain more detailed information when
	available.

    p4 ldapsync -u [ -c -U -d ] [ -n ] [ -i <N> ] [ ldap ... ]

	When run with the -g flag specified, this command updates the users
	lists in Helix Core groups to match the lists of members in LDAP
	groups. If one or more group names are provided, only those groups
	are updated; if no groups are provided, then all groups with LDAP
	configurations will be updated.

	When run with the -u flag specified, this command updates the Helix
	Core users to match those in the LDAP.  This works by querying each
	LDAP server defined by the LDAP specifications passed in the arguments.
	The LDAP specification's SearchFilter is used to query the LDAP server
	with the %%user%% placeholder expanded to * in order to identify all
	LDAP users.  The three Attribute* fields are used to map LDAP result to
	the Helix Core user's username, full name and email address.  All
	provided LDAP specifications are queried to build a full, combined list
	of LDAP users before any changes to the Helix Core users are made.

	The user synchronization  has three actions that must be enabled
	separately by specifying the appropriate flags:

	    The -c flag creates any new users found in the LDAP servers that
	    do not yet exist in Helix Core. The AuthMethod will be set to ldap
	    and Type set to standard.

	    The -U flag updates the full name and email address of any existing
	    Helix Core users found in the LDAP servers, provided that the user
	    is of Type standard and AuthMethod ldap and that the values differ.

	    The -d flag deletes any Helix Core users not found in any of the
	    LDAP servers, provided that the user is of Type standard and
	    AuthMethod ldap.

	To keep users or groups with LDAP configurations in sync with their
	LDAP counterparts, ldapsync can be set as a startup command, and will
	run in the background.

	The -n flag previews the operations without altering the users or
	groups.

	The -i flag causes the command to automatically repeat its action
	every N seconds. If -i is not specified, the command runs once,
	then exits.

       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and

       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
       and conversions to other media types.

       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and

       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       and conversions to other media types.

       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and

       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

	license file in the Helix Core root directory. Typically this command
	lets an administrator add extra licensed users to the Helix Core
	Server without having to shut the server down and copy the license
	file to	the server root.

	Most new license files obtained from Helix Core can be installed with
	this command, unless the server's IP address or port has changed.
	In that case, stop the server, copy the new license file to the root,
	and restart the server.

	The -o flag writes the license file to the standard output.

	The -i flag reads a license file from the standard input.

	The -u flag reports the license limits and how many entities are in
	use towards the limits.

	The -L flag lists valid server IP and MAC addresses to be used when
	requesting a valid license from Perforce Support.

	This command requires 'super' access (or 'admin' for '-u'),

	The -l flag specifies the name of the temporary label that should be
	used to access the list.  In the event that a label with that name
	already exists, the in-memory name has precedence over the stored one.
	Without the '-l' option the list command assigns a unique name to the

	The login2 command enables a user requiring multi factor
	authentication to authorize access on a given host.

	The -p flag causes the multi factor authorization to persist even
	after the user's ticket has expired.  The authorization status can
	still be invalidated by running 'p4 logout'.

	options: -c changelist# -F -K -m max -n -Ob -q

	'p4 merge' merges changes from one set of files (the 'source') into
	another (the 'target'). It is a simplified form of the 'p4 integrate'
	command, similar to 'p4 integrate -Rbd -Or'.

	Using the client workspace as a staging area, 'p4 merge' schedules all
	affected target files to be resolved per changes in the source.
	Target files outside of	the current client view are not affected.
	Source files need not be within the client view.

	'p4 resolve' must be used to resolve all changes.  'p4 submit' commits
	merged files to	the depot.  Unresolved files may not be submitted.
	Merged files can be shelved with 'p4 shelve' and abandoned with
	'p4 revert'.  The commands 'p4 integrated' and 'p4 filelog' display
	merge history.

	When 'p4 merge' schedules a workspace file to be resolved, it leaves
	it read-only. 'p4 resolve' can operate on a read-only file;  for
	other pre-submit changes, 'p4 edit' must be used to make the file
	writable.

	By default, 'p4 merge' merges changes into the current stream from its
	parent, or from another stream specified by the --from flag.
	
	If the current client is not associated with a stream, the source and
	target can be specified on the command line as a pair of file paths.
	More complex merge mappings can be specified via branchspecs as with
	'p4 integrate' (see 'p4 help integrate').

	Each file in the target is mapped to a file in the source. Mapping
	adjusts automatically for files that have been moved or renamed, as
	long as 'p4 move' was used to move/rename files.  The scope of source
	and target file sets must include both old-named and new-named files
	for mappings to be adjusted.  Moved source files may schedule moves
	to be resolved in target files.

	revRange is a revision or a revision range that limits the span of
	source history to be probed for unintegrated revisions.  For details
	about revision specifiers, see 'p4 help revisions'.

	The typical use of 'p4 merge' is to merge into the current stream
	from its parent stream (or the stream specified by --from). More
	advanced uses of 'p4 merge' are possible, using the flags as described
	by 'p4 help integ'.

	The -F flag can be used to force merging against a stream's expected
	flow, or to use an arbitrarily specified view to merge into a stream.

	Stream specifications may also be merged along with stream files.
	Any field in the source specification which has an Openable property of
	'propagate' will be merged to the target specification. The -Af and
	-As flags control whether stream files or the stream spec is merged.

		-Af	Perform merge with files only.
		-As	Perform merge with stream specs only.

	Both stream files and the stream spec will be merged if neither -Af
	nor -As is specified.  See 'p4 help streamspecinteg' for more details.

	The -Ob flag causes the base revision (if any) to be displayed along
	with each scheduled resolve.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion when updating ktext files on
	the client.

	The -q flag suppresses normal output messages. Messages regarding
	errors or exceptional conditions are displayed.

    p4 move [-c changelist#] [-f -n -k] [-t filetype] fromFile toFile
    p4 move -r [-c changelist#] [-n -k] fromFile toFile

	Move by default takes an already opened file and moves it from one
	client location to another, reopening it as a pending depot move.
	When the file is submitted with 'p4 submit', its depot file is moved
	accordingly. The 'p4 move' command is intended for moves that occur
	within the same branch and not for restructuring the depot by moving
	an entire branch.

	Wildcards in fromFile and toFile must match. The fromFile must be
	a file open for add or edit unless invoked with '-r'.

	'p4 opened' lists pending moves. 'p4 diff' can compare a moved
	client file with its depot original, 'p4 sync' can schedule an
	update of a moved file, and 'p4 resolve' can resolve the update.

	A client file can be moved many times before it is submitted.
	Moving a file back to its original location will undo a pending
	move, leaving unsubmitted content intact.  Using 'p4 revert'
	undoes the move and reverts the unsubmitted content.

	If -c changelist# is specified, the file is reopened in the
	specified pending changelist as well as being moved.

	The -f flag forces a move to an existing target file. The file
	must be synced and not opened.  The originating source file will
	no longer be synced to the client.

	If -t filetype is specified, the file is assigned that filetype.
	If the filetype is a partial filetype, the partial filetype is
	combined with the current filetype.  See 'p4 help filetypes'.

	The -n flag previews the operation without moving files.

	The -k flag performs the rename on the server without modifying
	client files. Use with caution, as an incorrect move can cause
	discrepancies between the state of the client and the corresponding
	server metadata.

	The -r flag may be used to rename existing files without altering
	content or type to a new target. This option allows the user to
	move files from the depot to a different location without opening
	the files first. Since this option performs a strict rename only,
	the '-t' and '-f' flags are not allowed, source files must not be
	already opened, and the targets must not already exist.

	The 'move' command requires a release 2009.1 or newer client. The
	'-f' flag requires a 2010.1 client.

    p4 obliterate [-y -A -b -a -h -l -T] [-r alg]
	    [-p | --purged-only] [ -q ] file[revRange] ...

	Obliterate permanently removes files and their history from the server.
	(See 'p4 delete' for the non-destructive way to delete a file.)
	Obliterate retrieves the disk space used by the obliterated files
	in the archive and clears the files from the metadata that is
	maintained by the server.  Files in client workspaces are not
	physically affected, but they are no longer under Helix Core control.

	Obliterate is aware of lazy copies made when 'p4 integrate' creates
	a branch, and does not remove copies that are still in use. Because
	of this, obliterating files does not guarantee that the corresponding
	files in the archive will be removed.

	If the file argument has a revision, the specified revision is
	obliterated.  If the file argument has a revision range, the
	revisions in that range are obliterated.  See 'p4 help revisions'
	for help.

	By default, obliterate displays a preview of the results. To execute
	the operation, you must specify the -y flag.

	Obliterate has three flags that can improve performance (-b, -a, -h):

	The '-b' flag restricts files in the argument range to those that
	are branched, are both the first revision and the head revision, and
	are not opened on any client.  This flag is useful for removing old
	branches while keeping files of interest (files that were modified).

	The '-a' flag skips the archive search and removal phase. File
	content is not removed. This option is safe to use with the '-b'
	option.

	The '-h' flag instructs obliterate not to search db.have for all
	possible matching records to delete.  Usually, db.have is one of the
	largest tables in a repository and consequently this search takes
	a long time.  Do not use this flag when obliterating branches or
	namespaces for reuse,  because the old content on any client
	will not match the newly-added repository files.  Note that use of
	the -h flag has the side-effect of cleaning the obliterated files
	from client workspaces when they are synced.

	The '-l' flag works similar to '-h' but for db.label. It instructs
	obliterate not to search db.label for all possible matching records
	to delete.

	The '-p' flag instructs obliterate to mark the revision as purged
	and leave the integration history intact rather than removing
	the records.

	The '-r alg' flag selects the algorithm used to purge the integration
	records. The original algorithm scans the integration table looking
	for a match with the rev table. The new algorithm scans the rev
	table looking for a match with the integration table. As searches
	using a changelist number only operate on the rev table it is
	more efficient to use the new algorithm for file arguments that
	includes a changelist number or revision. By default the algorithm
	selected is decided by examining the file arguments. This option
	forces the use of a particular algorithm. When 'alg' is set to 0,
	then the original algorithm will be used. When alg is set to 1, then
	the new algorithm will be used.

	The '-T' flag is required for obliterating task stream paths.
	Without this flag, if an argument for obliterate includes task
	stream paths, a message will be reported to use '-T'.

	The '--purged-only' flag only searches for and removes previously
	purged records created by an earlier call to 'p4 obliterate -p -y'.
	It ignores the '-b', '-h' flags and enables '-a'. It removes all
	the associated meta-data (integration, client and  work records).

	The '-q' flag supresses the output messages concerning purged or
	deleted revision records or deleted archives.

	When a revision has been archived, its action is changed to archive.
	By default, obliterate will not process a revision which has been
	archived. To include such revisions, you must specify the -A flag.
	Note that obliterate -A does not affect the metadata and content in
	the archive depot. To remove the metadata and content in the archive
	depot, see 'p4 help archive' and the corresponding '-p' flag. Note
	also that obliterating an archive revision with the -A flag means
	you can no longer restore it nor use 'archive -p', so typically you
	should use 'archive -p' instead of 'obliterate -A'.

	If you are obliterating files in order to entirely remove a depot
	from the server, and files in that depot have been integrated to
	other depots, run 'p4 snap' first to break those linkages, so that
	obliterate can remove the unreferenced archive files. If, instead,
	you specify '-a' to skip the archive removal phase, then you will
	need to specify '-f' when deleting the depot, since the presence
	of the archive files will prevent the depot deletion.

	Performance may be affected when a large number of file revisions
	are being obliterated, so it is recommended that the command be run
	during a maintenance or quiet period on the server.

	'p4 obliterate' requires 'admin' access, which is granted by 'p4
	protect'.

	The target must be completely empty of files, including deleted files.

	Source and target files (fromFile and toFile) can be specified on

	With a branch view, a toFile argument can be given to limit the scope

	Use 'p4 populate -r -S' to branch a child stream from its parent.
	The -S flag makes 'p4 populate' use a generated branch view that maps
	the stream (or its underlying real stream) to its parent.  With -r,
	the direction of the mapping is reversed.  -P can be used to generate
	the branch view using a parent stream other than the stream's actual
	parent.

	The -b flag makes 'p4 populate' use a user-defined branch view.  (See
	'p4 help branch'.) The source is the left side of the branch view
	and the target is the right side. With -r, the direction is reversed.

	             protections that should thus apply.

	             For example, 'proxy-*' applies to all connections from
	             all proxies, brokers, and replicas, while
	             'proxy-10.0.0.5' identifies a client machine with an IP
	             address of 10.0.0.5 which is connecting to p4d through
	             a proxy, broker, or replica.

	             If you wish to write a single set of protections entries
	             which apply both to directly-connected clients as well
	             as to those which connect via a proxy, broker, or
	             replica, you can omit the 'proxy-' prefix and also set
	             dm.proxy.protects=0. In this case, the 'proxy-' prefix
	             is not prepended to the IP address of connections which
	             are made via a proxy, replica or broker.  Note that in
	             this scenario, all intermediate proxies, brokers, and
	             replicas should be at release 2012.1 or higher.

	    Path:    The part of the depot to which access is being granted
	             or denied.  To deny access to a depot path, preface the
	             path with a "-" character. These exclusionary mappings
	             apply to all access levels, even if only one access
	             level is specified in the first field.


	There are two additional fields in the protect specification that are
	not part of the protections table:

	    SubPath: The root path of the sub-protections table (only used when
	             editing a sub-protections table).

	    Update:  The date this specification was last modified (read-only).
	             If this date is modified, the protections table will not
	             be saved; however, ommitting this field will avoid the
	             modification check.


	Sub-protections tables:
	    It is possible to delegate management of parts of the protections
	    table to non-super users or groups by creating an entry with the
	    mode 'owner'.  These entries must have a unique path, without
	    wildcards except for a trailing '...'.  Users with 'super' or that
	    have been granted 'owner' for a path may run the 'p4 protect'
	    command specifying the granted path as an argument to access the
	    sub-protections table for that path.  Any entries in this table
	    will be appended to the effective protections table directly below
	    the 'owner' entry; if an 'owner' entry is removed, so are any
	    entries in the sub-protections table for that path.  The 'owner'
	    permission only grants access to the sub-protections table at the
	    specified path: it does not grant the specified user or group any
	    permissions on that path.  The owner may grant themselves 'admin'
	    permissions on that path.  Neither 'owner' nor 'super' entries may
	    be added to a sub-protections table, and any other entries' paths
	    must be within the scope of the sub-protections table's path.


	If a path argument is specified, and an 'owner' entry with the same
	path exists, then the sub-protections table for that path will be
	accessed instead of the main protections table.

	The -o flag writes the protection table to the standard output.
	The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag reads the protection table from the standard input.
	The user's editor is not invoked.

	After protections are defined, 'p4 protect' requires 'super' or 'owner'
	access.

	detects the following:

	1. files in depot missing from workspace, but still on have list
	2. files on workspace that are not in depot
	3. files modified in workspace that are not opened for edit

	By default, the files matching each condition above in the path
	are reconciled by opening files for delete (scenario 1), add
	(scenario 2), and/or edit (scenario 3). The -e, -a, and -d flags
	may be used to limit to a subset of these operations. If no file
	arguments are given, reconcile and status default to the current
	working directory.

	If the list of files to be opened includes both adds and deletes,
	the missing and added files will be compared and converted to pairs
	of move/delete and move/add operations if they are similar enough.

	In addition to opening unopened files, reconcile will detect files
	that are currently opened for edit but missing from the workspace
	and reopen them for delete. Reconcile will also detect files opened
	for delete that are present on the workspace and reopen them for
	edit.

	The -n flag previews the operation without performing any action.
	Although metadata updates from reconcile require open permission,
	the preview commands only require read access.

	If -c changelist# is included, the files are opened in the specified
	pending changelist.

	The -e flag allows the user to reconcile files that have been
	modified outside of Helix Core. The reconcile command will open
	these files for edit.

	The -a flag allows the user to reconcile files that are in the
	user's directory that are not under Helix Core source control. These
	files are opened for add.

	The -f flag allows the user to add files with filenames that contain
	wildcard characters. Filenames that contain the special characters
	'@', '#', '%%' or '*' are reformatted to encode the characters using
	ASCII hexadecimal representation.  After the files are added, you
	must refer to them using the reformatted file name, because Helix Core
	does not recognize the local filesystem name.

	The -I flag informs the client that it should not perform any ignore
	checking configured by P4IGNORE.

	The -d flag allows the user to reconcile files that have been
	removed from the user's directory but are still in the depot.
	These files will be opened for delete only if they are still on the
	user's have list.

	The -t flag allows the user to reconcile files that are in the
	user's directory that had their file type changed. The reconcile
	command will open these files for edit even if the content is
	unchanged. Reconcile detects and changes filetype when the base
	filetype or executable mode has been changed. Modifiers such as
	'+l' and '+k' will be preserved. The '+w' attribute is not
	detected or handled by -t. The '+x' modifier will be unchanged
	by -t on platforms that don't support executable file bits,
	like Windows and VMS.

	The -l flag requests output in local file syntax using relative
	paths, similar to the workspace-centric view provided by 'status'.

	The -m flag used in conjunction with -e can be used to minimize
	costly digest computation on the client by checking file modification
	times before checking digests to determine if files have been
	modified outside of Helix Core.  If the modification times match the
	user's have list, the digest computations will be skipped.

	The -w flag forces the workspace files to be updated to match the
	depot rather than opening them so that the depot can be updated to
	match the workspace. The -a, -d, and -e flags when used with -w
	update workspace files as follows:

	  -a Files with no corresponding depot file are deleted.
	  -d Depot files not in the workspace are added.
	  -e Modified files are restored to the last version synced.

	Note the use of -w will result in the loss of any changes made
	to unopened files. Use of the -w flag requires read permission.

	The -k flag updates the have list when files in the workspace but
	not on the have list match content of corresponding files in the
	depot. In this case, the client's have list is updated to reflect
	the matching revisions. This option is used to reconcile the have
	list with the workspace.

	The -K flag (only used with 'p4 clean') suppresses keyword expansion
	when updating ktext files on the client.

	The -s flag (only used with 'p4 status') requests summarized
	output for the files to be opened for 'add'. Files in the current
	directory are listed as usual, but subdirectories containing files
	to be opened for 'add' are displayed instead of each file. This
	optimized option doesn't support move detection. Files to open
	for 'delete' and 'edit' are still listed individually.

	The status command displays preview output which includes files
	which are already opened in addition to the files that need to
	be reconciled. Opened files are not shown with options -A/-a/-e/-d.

	The 'p4 resolve' file argument specifies the target.  If the file
	argument is omitted, all unresolved files are resolved.

	Resolving can modify workspace files. To back up files, use 'p4
	shelve' before using 'p4 resolve'.

	The resolve process is a classic three-way merge. The participating
	files are referred to as follows:

	  'yours'       The target file open in the client workspace
	  'theirs'      The source file in the depot
	  'base'        The common ancestor; the highest revision of the
	                source file already accounted for in the target.
	  'merged'      The merged result.

	Filenames, filetypes, and text file content can be resolved by
	accepting 'yours', 'theirs', or 'merged'.  Branching, deletion, and
	binary file content can be resolved by accepting either 'yours' or
	'theirs'.

	When resolving integrated changes, 'p4 resolve' distinguishes among
	four results: entirely yours, entirely theirs, a pure merge, or an
	edited merge.  The distinction is recorded when resolved files are
	submitted, and will be used by future commands to determine whether
	integration is needed.

	In all cases, accepting 'yours' leaves the target file in its current
	state.  The result of accepting 'theirs' is as follows:

	   Content:     The target file content is overwritten.
	   Attribute:   The target's attributes are replaced.
 	   Branching:	A new target is branched.
 	   Deletion:    The target file is deleted.
 	   Filename:	The target file is moved or renamed.
 	   Filetype:    The target file's type is changed.

	For each unresolved change, the user is prompted to accept a result.
	Content and non-content changes are resolved separately.  For content,
	'p4 resolve' places the merged result into a temporary file in the
	client workspace.  If there are any conflicts, the merged file contains
	conflict markers that must be removed by the user.

	'p4 resolve' displays a count of text diffs and conflicts, and offers
	the following prompts:

	  Accept:
	     at              Keep only changes to their file.
	     ay              Keep only changes to your file.
	   * am              Keep merged file.
	   * ae              Keep merged and edited file.
	   * a               Keep autoselected file.

	  Diff:
	   * dt              See their changes alone.
	   * dy              See your changes alone.
	   * dm              See merged changes.
	     d               Diff your file against merged file.

	  Edit:
	     et              Edit their file (read only).
	     ey              Edit your file (read/write).
	   * e               Edit merged file (read/write).

	  Misc:
	   * m               Run '$P4MERGE base theirs yours merged'.
			     (Runs '$P4MERGEUNICODE charset base theirs
			      yours merged' if set and the file is a
			      unicode file.)
	     s               Skip this file.
	     h               Print this help message.
	     ^C              Quit the resolve operation.

	Options marked (*) appear only for text files. The suggested action
	will be displayed in brackets.

	The 'merge' (m) option enables you to invoke your own merge program, if
	one is configured using the $P4MERGE environment variable.  Four files
	are passed to the program: the base, yours, theirs, and the temporary
	file. The program is expected to write merge results to the temporary
	file.

	The -A flag can be used to limit the kind of resolving that will be
	attempted; without it, everything is attempted:

	    -Aa		Resolve attributes.
	    -Ab		Resolve file branching.
	    -Ac		Resolve file content changes.
	    -Ad		Resolve file deletions.
	    -Am		Resolve moved and renamed files.
	    -At		Resolve filetype changes.
	    -AQ		Resolve charset changes.

	The -a flag puts 'p4 resolve' into automatic mode. The user is not
	prompted, and files that can't be resolved automatically are skipped:

	    -as		'Safe' resolve; skip files that need merging.
	    -am 	Resolve by merging; skip files with conflicts.
	    -af		Force acceptance of merged files with conflicts.
	    -at		Force acceptance of theirs; overwrites yours.
	    -ay		Force acceptance of yours; ignores theirs.

	The -as flag causes the workspace file to be replaced with their file
	only if theirs has changed and yours has not.

	The -am flag causes the workspace file to be replaced with the result
	of merging theirs with yours. If the merge detected conflicts, the
	file is left untouched and unresolved.

	The -af flag causes the workspace file to be replaced with the result
	of merging theirs with yours, even if there were conflicts.  This can
	leave conflict markers in workspace files.

	The -at flag resolves all files by copying theirs into yours. It
	should be used with care, as it overwrites any changes made to the
	file in the client workspace.

	The -ay flag resolves all files by accepting yours and ignoring
	theirs. It preserves the content of workspace files.

	Note that there is a subtle distinction between manually accepting a
	merge resolve ('p4 resolve' and selecting 'am') and automatic merge
	resolve ('p4 resolve -am'). When accepting a merge resolve, the user
	makes a conscious choice.  With automatic merge resolves, the choice is
	automated and the result will depend on the three way merge differences
	between the target and source files.

	With an automatic merge resolve, if there are only additions or
	deletions in the target file, the target differences will be kept (the
	same as a manual accept yours).  If there are only additions or
	deletions in the source file, the source differences will be kept (the
	same as a manual accept theirs).  If there are additions or deletions
	in both the source and target files and there are no conflicts, the
	merged result is kept.

	In other words, 'p4 resolve -am' does not guarantee that all source
	and target files will be merged, only that the choice of whether to
	accept yours, accept theirs, or accept merge will be automated based
	upon the three way merge differences described above.

	The -d flags can be used to control handling of whitespace and line
	endings when merging files:

	    -db		Ignore whitespace changes.
	    -dw		Ignore whitespace altogether.
	    -dl 	Ignores line endings.

	The -d flags are also passed to the diff options in the 'p4 resolve'
	dialog. Additional -d flags that modify the diff output but do not
	modify merge behavior include -dn (RCS), -dc (context), -ds (summary),
	and -du (unified). Note that 'p4 resolve' uses content from the depot
	file if the files differ only in whitespace.

	The -f flag enables previously resolved content to be resolved again.
	By default, after files have been resolved, 'p4 resolve' does not
	process them again. The content of the target (yours) file being
	re-resolved is the result of the previous resolve, not the content of
	the original file. To preserve the option of using the original file,
	revert the resolved file.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion when updating ktext files on
	the client.

	The -n flag previews the operation without altering files.

	The -N flag previews the operation with additional information about
	any non-content resolve actions that are scheduled.

	The -o flag displays the base file name and revision to be used
	during the merge.

	The -t flag forces 'p4 resolve' to attempt a textual merge, even for
	files with non-text (binary) types.

	The -v flag causes 'p4 resolve' to insert markers for all changes,
	not just conflicts.

	The -c flag limits 'p4 resolve' to the files in changelist#.

	See 'p4 help-graph resolve' for information on using this command with
	graph depots.

	By default, 'p4 shelve' creates a changelist, adds files from the
	user's default changelist, then shelves those files in the depot.
	The user is presented with a text changelist form displayed using
	the editor configured using the $P4EDITOR environment variable.

	If a file pattern is specified, 'p4 shelve' shelves the files that
	match the pattern. When files are opened in the default changelist,
	only a single file pattern can be specified when creating a shelf;
	a file pattern containing wildcards can be used to match and shelve
	multiple files.

	The -Af flag specifies that only files should be shelved with this
	changelist.  The -As flag specifies that only an opened stream
	specification should be shelved with this change list.  By default,
	if the stream spec is open and neither -Af nor -As is given, the
	stream specification will also be included with any shelved
	files.  (See 'p4 help streamcmds'.)

	The -i flag reads the pending changelist specification with shelved
	files from the standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.
	To modify an existing changelist with shelved files, specify the
	changelist number using the -c flag.

	The -c flag specifies the pending changelist that contains shelved
	files to be created, deleted, or modified. Only the user and client
	of the pending changelist can add or modify its shelved files. Any
	files specified by the file pattern must already be opened in the
	specified changelist; use 'p4 reopen' to move an opened file from
	one changelist to another.

	The -f (force) flag must be used with the -c or -i flag to overwrite
	any existing shelved files in a pending changelist.

	The -r flag (used with -c or -i) enables you to replace all shelved
	files in that changelist with the files opened in your own workspace
	at that changelist number.  Previously shelved files will be deleted.
	Only the user and client workspace of the pending changelist can
	replace its shelved files.

	The -a flag enables you to handle unchanged files similarly to some
	client submit options, namely 'submitunchanged' and 'leaveunchanged'.
	The default behavior of shelving all files corresponds to the
	'submitunchanged' option. The 'leaveunchanged' option only shelves
	changed files, and then leaves the files opened in the pending
	changelist on the client.

	The -d flag (used with -c) deletes the shelved files in the specified
	changelist so that they can no longer be unshelved.  By default, only
	the user and client of the pending changelist can delete its shelved
	files. A user with 'admin' access can delete shelved files by including
	the -f flag to force the operation.

	If the shelved changelist includes a stream spec, by default it is
	deleted when all files have been deleted; the -As flag forces the
	the stream spec to be deleted even if files remain.

	The -p flag promotes a shelved change from an edge server to a commit
	server where it can be accessed by other edge servers participating
	in the distributed configuration.  Once a shelved change has been
	promoted, all subsequent local modifications to the shelf are also
	pushed to the commit server and remain until the shelf is deleted.
	Once a shelf has been created, the combination of flags '-p -c' will
	promote the shelf without modification unless '-f' or '-r' are also
	used to update the shelved files before promotion.

	The --parallel flag specifies options for parallel file transfer. If
	parallel file transfer has been enabled by setting the
	net.parallel.max configurable, and if there are sufficient resources
	across the system, a shelve command may execute more rapidly by
	transferring multiple files in parallel. Specify threads=N to request
	files be sent concurrently, using N independent network connections.
	The N threads grab work in batches: specify batch=N to control the
	number of files in a batch. A shelve that is too small will not
	initiate parallel file transfers: specify min=N to control the
	minimum number of files in a parallel shelve. Promoted shelves
	require an additional file transfer from the Edge to Commit Server.
	Parallel pull threads for this transfer are only used if the
	ExternalAddress field is set in its Edge Server spec and pull threads
	can be used on the Commit Server. This transfer using pull threads
	is currently not supported on Windows platforms.

	Auto parallel shelve may be enabled by setting the
	net.parallel.shelve.threads configurable to the desired number
	of threads to be used for all shelve commands. This value must be
	less than or equal to the value of net.parallel.max. Other
	net.parallel.shelve.* configurables may be specified as well, but
	are not required. See 'p4 help configurables' to see the options
	and their defaults. Auto parallel shelve is turned off by unsetting
	the net.parallel.shelve.threads configurable. A user may override
	the configured auto parallel shelve options on the command line,
	or may disable it via 'p4 shelve --parallel=0'.

	'p4 submit' commits a pending changelist and the files it contains to
	the depot, and/or submit an open stream spec.

	By default, 'p4 submit' attempts to submit all files in the 'default'
	changelist.  Submit displays a dialog where you enter a description
	of the change and, optionally, delete files from the list of files
	to be checked in.

	To add files to a changelist before submitting, use any of the
	commands that open client workspace files: 'p4 add', 'p4 edit',
	etc.

	If the file parameter is specified, only files in the default
	changelist that match the pattern are submitted.

	Files in a stream path can be submitted only by client workspaces
	dedicated to the stream. See 'p4 help client'.

	Before committing a changelist, 'p4 submit' locks all the files being
	submitted. If any file cannot be locked or submitted, the files are
	left open in a numbered pending changelist. By default, the files in
	a failed submit operation are left locked unless the
	submit.unlocklocked configurable is set. Files are unlocked even if
	they were manually locked prior to submit if submit fails when
	submit.unlocklocked is set. 'p4 opened' shows unsubmitted files
	and their changelists.

	Submit is atomic: if the operation succeeds, all files are updated
	in the depot. If the submit fails, no depot files are updated.

	If submit fails, some or all of the files may have been copied to
	the server. By default, retrying a failed submit will transfer all of
	the files again unless the submit.noretransfer configurable is set.
	If submit.noretransfer is set to 1, submit uses digest comparisons to
	to detect if the files have already been transferred in order to
	avoid file re-transfer when retrying a failed submit.

	The --noretransfer flag is used to override the submit.noretransfer
	configurable so the user can choose the preferred re-transfer
	behavior during the current submit operation.

	The -So and -Sx flags can be used to control whether an open stream
	spec in the default changelist will be submitted.  Use -So with no file
	list to submit only the open stream spec in the default changelist.
	Use -Sx with a file list to exclude the open stream spec when
	submitting files in the default changelist; use -Sx with no file list
	to submit all files without submitting the open stream spec.

	By default, if both the -So and -Sx flags are omitted, then an open
	stream spec will be submitted along with any files in the given
	filelist.  (See 'p4 help streamcmds'.)

	The -c flag submits the specified pending changelist instead of the
	default changelist. Additional changelists can be created manually,
	using the 'p4 change' command, or automatically as the result of a
	failed attempt to submit the default changelist.

	The -e flag submits a shelved changelist without transferring files
	or modifying the workspace. The shelved change must be owned by
	the person submitting the change, but the client may be different.
	However, files shelved to a stream target may only be submitted by
	a stream client that is mapped to the target stream. In addition,
	files shelved to a non-stream target cannot be submitted by a stream
	client. To submit a shelved change, all files in the shelved change
	must be up to date and resolved. No files may be open in any workspace
	at the same change number. Client submit options (ie revertUnchanged,
	etc) will be ignored. If the submit is successful, the shelved change
	and files are cleaned up, and are no longer available to be unshelved
	or submitted.

	The -d flag passes a description into the specified changelist rather
	than displaying the changelist dialog for manual editing. This option
	is useful for scripting, but does not allow you to add jobs or modify
	the default changelist.

	The -f flag enables you to override submit options that are configured
	for the client that is submitting the changelist.  This flag overrides
	the -r (reopen)flag, if it is specified.  See 'p4 help client' for
	details about submit options.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion when updating ktext files on
	the client after submit.

	The -i flag reads a changelist specification from the standard input.
	The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -r flag reopens submitted files in the default changelist after
	submission.

	The -s flag extends the list of jobs to include the fix status
	for each job, which becomes the job's status when the changelist
	is committed.  See 'p4 help change' for details.

	The --parallel flag specifies options for parallel file transfer. If
	parallel file transfer has been enabled by setting the
	net.parallel.max configurable, and if there are sufficient resources
	across the system, a submit command may execute more rapidly by
	transferring multiple files in parallel. Specify threads=N to request
	files be sent concurrently, using N independent network connections.
	The N threads grab work in batches; specify batch=N to control the
	number of files in a batch. A submit that is too small will not
	initiate parallel file transfers; specify min=N to control the
	minimum number of files in a parallel submit. Requesting progress
	indicators causes the --parallel flag to be ignored.

	Using --parallel from an edge server allows parallel file transfer
	from the edge server to the commit server. This uses standard pull
	threads to transfer the files. Note that an administrator must ensure
	that pull threads can be run on the commit server. The edge server ip
 	address and port number	used by the commit server to connect to the
	edge server must be specified in the ExternalAddress field of the
	edge server spec. Note that parallel submit is not supported from an
	edge server if the commit server is on a Windows platform. In this
	case --parallel	or auto	parallel submit will be silently ignored, and
	the submit will run without using parallel threads.

	Auto parallel submit may be enabled by setting the
	net.parallel.submit.threads configurable to the desired number
	of threads to be used for all submit commands. This value must be
	less than or equal to the value of net.parallel.max. Other
	net.parallel.submit.* configurables may be specified as well, but
	are not required. See 'p4 help configurables' to see the options
	and their defaults. Auto parallel submit is turned off by unsetting
	the net.parallel.submit.threads configurable. A user may override
	the configured auto parallel submit options on the command line,
	or may disable it via 'p4 submit --parallel=0`.

	An edge-content trigger can be used to transfer archive files from
	an Edge to its Commit Server using an alternative file transfer
	mechanism. This option is only used in a distributed environment and
	is not supported for RCS storage. The configurable pull.trigger.dir
	must be set to a location to write temporary files. The configurable
	rpl.submit.nocopy must be set to 1 to suppress default Helix Core
	archive file transfer to the Commit Server. The trigger must use
	'fstat -Ob' to get the list of files to transfer, and it must contain
	the file transfer commands.

	The -b flag can be used on an edge server to enable archive transfer
	from the edge to the commit server to be done in background. The
	submit process on the commit server will schedule the transfers
	and complete the submit without waiting for transfers to finish.
	The archives on the originating edge server will be transferred to
	the commit server via pull threads initiated by submit on the
	commit server. Archives of ktext files will be transferred
	serially as usual rather than in background since archive content
	depends on commit server work. Also note that submitting pending
	(not shelved) changes using this feature will cause any
	change-submit triggers to be fired before edge-content triggers. An
	administrator must ensure that pull threads can be run on the commit
	server. The edge server IP address and port number used by the
	commit server to connect to the edge server must be specified in the
	ExternalAddress field of the edge server spec. The configurables
	submit.allowbgtransfer and lbr.autocompress must be set for all
	servers using this feature, including the commit server. This
	feature is not supported for graph depots. This option will be
	ignored if alternative file transfer or lbr.replication=shared is
	configured. This option is also ignored when submit is not run
	from an edge server, or when submit.allowbgtransfer is not set.
	If noretransfer is configured, noretransfer will be ignored.
	If archives failed to transfer to the commit server, they may be
	fetched on the commit server using 'p4 pull -u -t' to pull archives
	from the edge address specified by -t. The failed transfers are visible
	on the commit server via 'p4 pull -l' which also shows the target
	address for each failed transfer. Please see 'p4 help pull' for
	more details.

	Auto background archive transfer may be enabled by setting the
	submit.autobgtransfer configurable to 1 on the edge servers which
	require this functionality. When this is set in addition to the
	required settings for using -b, all submits from that edge will
	use background archive transfer without requiring -b on the command
	line.

	See 'p4 help-graph submit' for information on using this command with
	graph depots.

	Sync updates the client workspace to reflect its current view (if
	it has changed) and the current contents of the depot (if it has
	changed). The client view maps client and depot file names and
	locations.

	Sync adds files that are in the client view and have not been
	retrieved before.  Sync deletes previously retrieved files that
	are no longer in the client view or have been deleted from the
	depot.  Sync updates files that are still in the client view and
	have been updated in the depot.

	By default, sync affects all files in the client workspace. If file
	arguments are given, sync limits its operation to those files.
	The file arguments can contain wildcards.

	If the file argument includes a revision specifier, then the given
	revision is retrieved.  Normally, the head revision is retrieved.

	If the file argument includes a revision range specification,
	only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
	highest revision in the range is used.

	See 'p4 help revisions' for help specifying revisions or ranges.

	Normally, sync does not overwrite workspace files that the user has
	manually made writable.  Setting the 'clobber' option in the
	client specification disables this safety check.

	The -f flag forces resynchronization even if the client already
	has the file, and overwriting any writable files.  This flag doesn't
	affect open files.

	The -L flag can be used with multiple file arguments that are in
	full depot syntax and include a valid revision number. When this
	flag is used the arguments are processed together by building an
	internal table similar to a label. This file list processing is
	significantly faster than having to call the internal query engine
	for each individual file argument. However, the file argument syntax
	is strict and the command will not run if an error is encountered.

	The -n flag previews the operation without updating the workspace.

	The -N flag also previews the operation without updating the
	workspace, but reports only a summary of the work the sync would do.

	The -k flag updates server metadata without syncing files. It is
	intended to enable you to ensure that the server correctly reflects
	the state of files in the workspace while avoiding a large data
	transfer. Caution: an erroneous update can cause the server to
	incorrectly reflect the state of the workspace.

	The -K flag suppresses keyword expansion.

	The -p flag populates the client workspace, but does not update the
	server to reflect those updates.  Any file that is already synced or
	opened will be bypassed with a warning message.  This option is very
	useful for build clients or when publishing content without the
	need to track the state of the client workspace.

	The -q flag suppresses normal output messages. Messages regarding
	errors or exceptional conditions are not suppressed.

	The -r flag allows open files which are mapped to new locations
	in the depot to be reopened in the new location.  By default, open
	workspace files remain associated with the depot files that they were
	originally opened as.

	The -s flag adds a safety check before sending content to the client
	workspace.  This check uses MD5 digests to compare the content on the
	clients workspace against content that was last synced.  If the file
	has been modified outside of Helix Core's control then an error message
	is displayed and the file is not overwritten.  This check adds some
	extra processing which will affect the performance of the operation.
	Clients with 'allwrite' and 'noclobber' set do this check by default.

	The -m flag limits sync to the first 'max' number of files. This
	option is useful in conjunction with tagged output and the '-n'
	flag, to preview how many files will be synced without transferring
	all the file data.

	The -E flag verifies that any changelists specified in the revRange
	are existing, submitted changes before performing the sync.

	The --parallel flag specifies options for parallel file transfer. If
	your administrator has enabled parallel file transfer by setting the
	net.parallel.max configurable, and if there are sufficient resources
	across the system, a sync command may execute more rapidly by
	transferring multiple files in parallel. Specify threads=N to request
	files be sent concurrently, using N independent network connections.
	The N threads grab work in batches; specify batch=N to control the
	number of files in a batch and/or batchsize=N to control the number of
	bytes in a batch. A sync that is too small will not initiate parallel
	file transfers; specify min=N to control the minimum number of files
	in a parallel sync and/or minsize=N to control the minimum number of
	bytes in a parallel sync. Requesting progress indicators causes the
	--parallel flag to be ignored.

	Auto parallel sync may be enabled by setting the net.parallel.threads
	configurable to the desired number of threads to be used by all sync
	commands. This value must be less than or equal to the value of
	net.parallel.max. Other net.parallel.* configurables may be specified
	as well, but are not required. See 'p4 help configurables' to see
	the options and their defaults. Auto parallel sync is turned off by
	unsetting the net.parallel.threads configurable. A user may override
	the configured auto parallel sync options on the command line, or may
	disable it via 'p4 sync --parallel=0'.

	The --use-stream-change flag specifies options for syncing stream
	clients using the stream view at or before change N.  If N=0, the
	current head version of the stream spec view is used.  If the
	StreamAtChange field is set in the client specification, then that
	value overrules any --use-stream-change value.

	If the configurable dm.sync.streamchange is set 1, then the
	--use-stream-change flag is used implicitly.  If a change specifier
	is used on the file arguments, then the stream view is derived from the
	stream spec version at or before the change specifier.  If multiple
	file arguments are used with different change specifiers, the greatest
	change number is used.  If no change specifiers are used, or at least
	one file in the filelist has no change specifier, then the stream view
	comes from the head version of the stream spec.  The
	--use-stream-change flag may also be used to override any change
	specifier on a file argument.

	The -c flag indicates the creation date. This flag helps in marking the
	topology records as deleted based on the specified date of creation.

	The -l flag indicates the last seen date. This flag helps in marking
	the records as deleted based on the specified date that represents the
	last time the server record was updated.

	The -D flag displays the preview of the deletion operation based on the
	date in epoch format. The date in this format can be found in the
	tagged topology output by running the command 'p4 -ztag topology'. To
	delete the specified records from the table, specify the -y flag.

	The -e flag ensures that the deletion operation also includes all the
	records dated earlier than the specified date.

	The -s flag indicates the server address. This flag is mandatory to
	delete records specific to that server address.

	The -p flag indicates the target address.
	
	The -i flag indicates the serverid.

	The -S flag indicates the new server address.

	The -P flag indicates the new target address.

	The -I flag indicates the new serverid.

	The -m flag indicates the move marker. This flag ensures that the move
	operation marks the specified source server record as being moved to
	the target server. This will preview the results unless the -y flag is
	also provided. If the topology record has the target address then
	it is mandatory to provide both the source target address (-p) and the
	new target address (-P).

	The -t flag displays all the recent configurations of the server
	services that have been recorded in the topology based on the requested
	past number of days from now.

	The -F filter flag limits output to records that match the filter
	pattern.  The filter pattern uses the same syntax as the -F filter
	flag on the 'p4 fstat' command.  Filtering is case-sensitive.

	The -T flag can be used to limit the fields that are displayed.

	This command requires that the user be an operator, or have 'super'
	access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	'p4 triggers' edits the table of triggers, which are used for
	change submission validation, form validation, external authentication,
	external job fix integration, external archive integration,
	post-failover and post-failback activities, server response
	monitoring, and command policies.

	Helix Core Extensions are a distinct means of customization, separate
	from triggers.  See 'p4 help extension'.

	Triggers are administrator-defined commands that the server runs
	to perform the following:

	Validate changelist submissions.

	    The server runs changelist triggers before the file transfer,
	    between file transfer and changelist commit, upon commit failure,
	    or after the commit.

	Validate shelve operations.

	    The server runs shelve triggers before files are shelved, after
	    files are shelved, or when shelved files have been discarded
	    (via shelve -d).

	Manipulate and validate forms.

	    The server runs form-validating triggers between generating
	    and outputting the form, between inputting and parsing the
	    form, between parsing and saving the form, or when deleting
	    the form.

	Authenticate or change a user password.

	    The server runs authentication triggers to either validate
	    a user password during login or when setting a new password.

	Intercept job fix additions or deletions.

	    The server run fix triggers prior to adding or deleting a fix
	    between a job and changelist.

	Access external archive files.

	    For files with the +X filetype modifier, the server runs an
	    archive trigger to read, write, or delete files in the archive.

	Command execution policy.

	    Command triggers can be specified to run before and after
	    processing of user requests.  Pre-execution triggers can
	    prevent the command from running.

	Server maintenance.

	    Journal rotation triggers can be specified to run after the
	    journals have rotated to the target server. These will only run
	    when the journal rotation is triggered by 'p4 admin journal',
	    'p4 admin checkpoint' or on replicas when they rotate to match
	    the master.

	Perform post-failover or post-failback activities.

	    The new master after a successful failover may run a failed-over
	    trigger to handle a DNS change, or any other changes that may
	    be required after the failover. A failed-back trigger may be
	    run after a successful failback to perform changes that may
	    be required after the failback.

	Monitor server responsiveness.

	    The 'p4 heartbeat' command that is used to ping a target server
	    may run 'heartbeat-missing', 'heartbeat-resumed', or
	    'heartbeat-dead' triggers based on the target server's responses.

	Validate graph pushes.

	    The server runs graph triggers before commit trees, lfs-files and
	    reference updates are received and after they have been committed
	    to the database.

	Perform alternative archive file transfer.

	    Pull-archive triggers can be used to replace the default
	    archive file transfer mechanism used by 'p4 pull'.

	The trigger form has a single entry 'Triggers:', followed by any
	number of trigger lines.  Each trigger line must be indented with
	spaces or tabs in the form. Triggers are executed in the order listed
	and if a trigger fails, subsequent triggers are not run.  A trigger
	succeeds if the executed command exits returning 0 and fails otherwise.
	Normally the failure of a trigger prevents the operation from
	completing, except for the commit and journal triggers, which run after
	the operation is complete, or the 'change-failed', 'heartbeat-missing',
	or 'heartbeat-resumed' triggers which are only advisory.

	Each trigger line contains a trigger name, a trigger type, a depot
	file path pattern matching where the trigger will be executed, a
	command name or form type and a command to run.

	Name:   The name of the trigger.  For change triggers, a run of the
		same trigger name on contiguous lines is treated as a single
		trigger so that multiple paths can be specified.  Only the
		command of the first such trigger line is used.

	Type:	When the trigger is to execute:

		archive:
		    Execute an archive trigger for the server to access
		    any file with the +X filetype modifier.

		auth-check:
		service-check:
		    Execute an authentication check trigger to verify a
		    user's password against an external password manager
		    during login or when setting a new password.

		auth-check-sso:
		    Facilitate a single sign-on user authentication. This
		    configuration requires two programs or scripts to run;
		    one on the client, the other on the server.

		    client:
		        Set the environment variable 'P4LOGINSSO' to point to
		        a script that can be executed to obtain the user's
		        credentials or other information that the server
		        trigger can verify.  The client-side script must
		        write the message to the standard output
		        (max length 128K).

		        Example:  P4LOGINSSO=/Users/joe/bin/runsso

		        The two variables available to this trigger are
		        %%P4PORT%% and %%serverAddress%%.  The distinction is
		        that serverAddress is the address of the target server
		        and the P4PORT is what the client is connecting to,
		        which might be an intermediate like a Helix Core Proxy.

		        These variables can be passed to the client script by
		        appending them to the client command string, as in:

		        P4LOGINSSO="/Users/joe/bin/runsso %%serverAddress%%"

		    server:
		        Execute an authentication (sso) trigger that gets
		        this message from the standard input and returns an
		        exit status of 0 (for verified) or otherwise failed.

		        Example:
		            sso auth-check-sso auth "/secure/verify %%user%%"

		    The user must issue the 'p4 login' command, but no
		    password prompting is invoked.  If the server
		    determines that the user is valid, they are issued a
		    Helix Core ticket just as if they had logged in with a
		    password.

		    Pre-2007.2 clients cannot run a client-side single
		    sign-on.  Specifying an 'auth-check' trigger as a backup
		    for a user to gain access will prompt the user for a
		    password if it's an older client or P4LOGINSSO has not
		    been configured.

		    Unlike passwords which are encrypted, the sso message is
		    sent to the server in clear text.

		auth-invalidate:
		    Execute an authentication invalidate trigger to inform
		    external authentication systems when 'p4 logout' is run.

		auth-set:
		    Execute an authentication set trigger to send a new
		    password to an external password manager.

		auth-pre-2fa:
		auth-init-2fa:
		auth-check-2fa:
		    Execute a multi factor authentication trigger.
		    See 'p4 help mfa' for more details.

		bgtask:
		    Store named command invocations for use with 'p4 bgtask'.

		change-submit:
		    Execute pre-submit trigger after changelist has been
		    created and files locked but prior to file transfer.

		change-content:
		    Execute mid-submit trigger after file transfer but prior
		    to commit.  Files can be accessed by the 'p4 diff2',
		    'p4 files', 'p4 fstat', and 'p4 print' commands using
		    the revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is
		    the pending changelist number passed as %%changelist%%.

		change-commit:
		    Execute post-submit trigger after changelist commit.

		change-failed:
		    Executes only if the changelist commit failed.
		    Note that this trigger only fires on errors
		    occurring after a commit process has started. It does
		    not fire for early usage errors, or due to errors from
		    the submit form. In short, if a change-* trigger
		    could have run, then the change-failed trigger
		    will fire if that commit fails.

		command:
		    Execute pre/post trigger when users run commands.

		edge-submit:
		    Execute pre-submit trigger on Edge Server after changelist
		    has been created but prior to file transfer.

		edge-content:
		    Execute mid-submit trigger on Edge Server after file
		    transfer but prior to beginning submit on Commit Server.
		    This trigger could be used to perform an alternative file
		    transfer mechanism for copying archive files from an
		    Edge to a Commit Server.

		failed-over:
		    Execute only when a new master first starts up after
		    successful failover. This trigger could be used to
		    perform a DNS change, or any other activities needed
		    to support replication after failover. The special
		    variables %%standbyserverid%% and %%standbyserverport%%
		    expand to the serverid and serverport of the standby
		    before it became the new master. %%serverid%% and
		    %%serverport%% refer to the current serverid and
		    serverport of the new master. Note that most of the
		    usual trigger variables are not available for this
		    trigger as this fires at server startup before
		    any client connection. Also note that multiple
		    failed-over triggers run in the background asynchronously,
		    and that a failed failed-over trigger will not prevent
		    any other failed-over triggers from running.

		failed-back:
		    Execute only when a new master first starts up after
		    successful failback. This trigger could be used to
		    perform a DNS change, or any other activities needed
		    to support replication after failback. The special
		    variables %%standbyserverid%% and %%standbyserverport%%
		    expand to the serverid and serverport of the standby
		    before it became the new master. %%serverid%% and
		    %%serverport%% refer to the current serverid and
		    serverport of the new master. Note that most of the
		    usual trigger variables are not available for this
		    trigger as this fires at server startup before
		    any client connection. Also note that multiple
		    failed-back triggers run in the background asynchronously,
		    and that a failed failed-back trigger will not prevent
		    any other failed-back triggers from running.

		fix-add:
		    Execute fix trigger prior to adding a fix.  The special
		    variable %%jobs%% is available for expansion and must be
		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one
		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix' command.

		fix-delete:
		    Execute fix trigger prior to deleting a fix.  The special
		    variable %%jobs%% is available for expansion and must be
		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one
		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix -d' command.

		form-out:
		    Execute form trigger on generation of form.	 Trigger may
		    modify form.

		form-in:
		    Execute form trigger on input of form before its contents
		    are parsed and validated.  Trigger may modify form.

		form-save:
		    Execute form trigger prior to save of form after its
		    contents are parsed.

		form-commit:
		    Execute form trigger after it has been committed, allowing
		    access to automatically generated fields (jobname, dates
		    etc).  It cannot modify the form.  This trigger for job
		    forms is run by 'p4 job' and 'p4 fix' (after the status
		    is updated), 'p4 change' (if the job is added or deleted)
		    and 'p4 submit' (if the job is associated with the change).
		    The 'form-commit' trigger has access to the new job name
		    created with 'p4 job', while the 'form-in' and 'form-save'
		    triggers are run before the job name is created.  The
		    special variable %%action%% is available on the job
		    'form-commit' trigger command line, and is expanded when
		    the job is modified by a fix.

		form-delete:
		    Execute form trigger prior to delete of form after its
		    contents are parsed.

		heartbeat-dead:
		    Execute heartbeat dead trigger when 'p4 heartbeat' has
		    detected that the target server is non-responsive or dead.

		heartbeat-missing:
		    Execute heartbeat missing trigger when 'p4 heartbeat' has
		    detected the first missing response from its target server.

		heartbeat-resumed:
		    Execute heartbeat resumed trigger when 'p4 heartbeat' has
		    detected the first resumed response after missing responses
		    from its target server.

		journal-rotate:
		    Execute journal rotation trigger after the journal has been
		    rotated and after the database has been unlocked.

		journal-rotate-lock:
		    Execute journal rotation trigger after the journal has been
		    rotated, but before the database has been unlocked. All
		    commands against the server will wait for the trigger to
		    complete before running: do not run commands against the
		    server from this trigger.

		pull-archive:
		    Execute pull archive trigger to perform archive file
		    transfer from within the trigger during 'p4 pull'.
		    This file transfer replaces the default file transfer
		    mechanism used by 'p4 pull'.

		shelve-submit:
		    Execute pre-shelve trigger after changelist has been
		    created but prior to file transfer. Also executed for
		    reshelve command.

		shelve-commit:
		    Execute post-shelve trigger after files are shelved or
		    reshelved.

		shelve-delete:
		    Execute shelve trigger prior to discarding shelved files.

		push-submit:
		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,
		    after changelist has been created on the destination
		    server and files are locked but prior to file transfer.

		push-content:
		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,
		    after file transfer but prior to commit. Files can be
		    accessed by the trigger using any of the 'p4 diff2',
		    'p4 files', 'p4 fstat', and 'p4 print' commands with
		    the revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is
		    the pending changelist number passed as %%changelist%%.

		push-commit:
		    Execute trigger during a push, fetch, or unzip operation,
		    after changelist commit.

		graph-push-start:
		    Execute trigger prior to any data being transferred as
		    part of a 'git push' operation through the connector or
		    a 'p4 submit' to a graph depot.

		graph-push-complete:
		    Execute trigger after a 'git push' operation has
		    completed through the connector or a 'p4 submit' to a
		    graph depot.

		graph-push-reference:
		    Execute trigger prior to a reference being created or
		    updated as part of a 'git push' operation through the
		    connector or a 'p4 submit' to a graph depot.

		graph-push-reference-complete:
		    Execute trigger after a reference has been created or
		    updated as part of a 'git push' operation through the
		    connector or a 'p4 submit' to a graph depot.

		graph-lfs-push:
		    Execute trigger prior to any LFS files being transferred.

R"(
	Path:   For change and submit triggers, a file pattern to match files
		in the changelist.  This file pattern can be an exclusion
		mapping (-pattern), to exclude files.  For form triggers, the
		name of the form (branch, client, etc).  For fix triggers
		'fix' is required as the path value.  For authentication
		triggers (including multi factor authentication triggers),
		'auth' is required as the path value. For archive triggers,
		a file pattern to match the name of the file being accessed
		in the archive.  Note that, due to lazy copying when branching
		files, the name of the file in the archive can not be the same
		as the name of the file in the depot.  For command triggers,
		use the name of the command to match, e.g. 'pre-user-$cmd'
		or a regular expression, e.g. '(pre|post)-user-add'.  For
		journal rotation triggers, set the path value to 'any' if
		the trigger should run on all servers or a suitable server.id
		or cluster.id may be used to restrict the trigger to running on
		either a specific server or a named group of servers.  For
		pull-archive triggers, 'pull' is required as the path value.
		For graph triggers, set the path to a file pattern that matches
		the desired repos.  The path should end with a wildcard even if
		only matching a single repo.  For 'bgtask' triggers, use a path
		of 'unset'. For 'failed-over' triggers, use 'failed-over' as
		the path. For 'failed-back' triggers, use 'failed-back' as the
		path. For 'heartbeat-dead', 'heartbeat-missing', and
		'heartbeat-resumed' triggers, use 'heartbeat' as the path.

		dictionary containing connection information that the trigger
		must read (with the exception of archive/auth triggers,
		which behave the same as when triggers.io=0.)

		If the command fails, the command's standard output (not
		error output) is sent to the client as the text of a trigger
		failure error message.

		If the command succeeds, the command's standard output is
		sent as an unadorned message to the client for all triggers
		except archive triggers; for archive triggers, the command's
		standard output is the file content.

	'p4 unshelve' retrieves shelved files from the specified pending
	changelist, opens them in a pending changelist and copies them
	to the invoking user's workspace.  Unshelving files from a pending
	changelist is restricted by the user's permissions on the files.
	A successful unshelve operation places the shelved files on the
	user's workspace with the same open action and pending integration
	history as if it had originated from that user and client.

	Unshelving a file over an already opened file is permitted if both
	shelved file and opened file are opened for 'edit'. In a distributed
	environment, the shelf must either be promoted or have been created
	on the same edge server. After unshelving, the workspace file is
	flagged as unresolved, and 'p4 resolve' must be run to resolve the
	differences between the shelved file and the workspace file.

	Unshelving a file opened for 'add' when the file already exists
	in the depot will result in the file being opened for edit. After
	unshelving, the workspace file is flagged as unresolved, and
	'p4 resolve' must be run to resolve the differences between the
	shelved file and the depot file at the head revision. Note that
	unshelving a file opened for 'add' over an already opened file is
	not supported.

	The -s flag specifies the number of the pending changelist that
	contains the shelved files.

	If a file pattern is specified, 'p4 unshelve' unshelves files that
	match the pattern.

	The -A flag specifies whether files and/or the stream spec (if any)
	associated with the shelved changelist should be unshelved to the
	current client; by default, the unshelve command acts on both the
	files (-Af) and the stream spec (-As).  (See 'p4 help streamcmds'.)

	The -b flag specifies a branch spec that the shelved files will be
	mapped through prior to being unshelved, allowing files to be shelved

	For each revision of the specified files, 'p4 verify' reports
	revision-specific information and an MD5 digest of the revision's
	contents.  See 'p4 help revisions' for help specifying revisions.

	By default, 'p4 verify' computes and displays the digest of each
	revision.  If a revision cannot be reproduced (for example, if the
	file is missing from the archive), the revision's output line ends
	with MISSING!  If there is a saved digest, 'p4 verify' compares it
	with the computed one. If they differ, the output line ends with BAD!

	The -m max flag specifies the maximum number of revisions to process.
	This option can be used with the -u flag to compute and save digests
	for a limited number of revisions in each 'p4 verify' invocation.

	When the '-t' flag is used on a replica any damaged or missing
	revisions are scheduled for transfer from the P4TARGET server.
	On a commit server the damaged or missing revisions will be scheduled
	for transfer from the first replica that confirms it has a valid
	archive file for that revision.
	The '-t' option cannot be used with the '-v', '-Z' or '-u' options.

	The -r flag is only used with the '-t' option. When the '-r'
	option is specified, then revisions of the text type (contained
	within an RCS file) are not transferred.

	The --only filter flag, where filter can be either 'BAD' or 'MISSING'
	selects which type of error is of interest. By selecting
	the 'MISSING' filter, only missing revisions will be reported
	and checksum calculations will be avoided. The '--only' flag can
	be combined with the '-t' flag to restrict the revisions
	to be transferred. The '--only' option cannot be used
	with the '-v', '-Z' or '-u' options.

	The --compressed flag may be used to override how revisions stored
	as compressed archives are verified. By default, if the digest
	of the compressed archive has been recorded, the archive is verified
	without extracting the content, falling back to verify the extracted
	content in the case that the compressed checksum doesn't match.
	Specifying '--compressed 0' will skip the attempt to verify the archive
	based on the compressed checksum, verifying only the extracted content.
	Specifying '--compressed 1' will prevent the second verify attempt
	against the extracted content, raising a verify error immediately.

	The -u flag computes and saves the digest only for revisions that
	have no saved digest.

	The -v flag computes and saves the digest for each revision, regardless
	of whether the revision already has a saved digest.  This option can
	be used to update the saved digest if the archive was deliberately
	changed. The '-u' and '-v' options are mutually exclusive.

	The -z flag optimizes digest computations by skipping revisions that
	have already been computed in the current pass. This option is useful
	when the specified files contain lazy copies.  The resulting output
	might report a lazy copy revision if it is the first revision in the
	sort order to access a common archive file. This option cannot be used
	with the '-v' or '-u' options.

	The -q flag minimizes command output, displaying only errors from
	mismatched digests or unreproducible revisions.

	The -s flag specifies that the file size should also be verified. The
	-v flag implies the -s flag.

	The -X flag specifies that files with the +X filetype modifier should
	be skipped.

	The -Z flag specifies that the digest and file length check should be
	performed by using the storage table as opposed to the revision table.
	Using the storage table should generally be faster as the lazy copied
	files will only be checked once. The output is slight different as the
	storage table does not contain the action and change fields available
	in the revision table. Instead the reference count value is displayed.
	Note that the 'file' argument is subtly different with this flag
	as a lazy copied depot file will not be selectable. To demonstrate this
	issue consider file //x/x with a lazy copy with the path //y/y. Calling
	'p4 verify -Z //y/...' will not verify any files as there will not be
	a storage record that matches the //y path. Whereas a
	'p4 verify //y/...' will use the revision table and find and check
	the //x/x file. You can only combine the -q option with this flag.

	By default, 'p4 verify' processes files in batches of 10000 files at
	a time. The -b flag specifies the batch size. Specify -b 0 to disable
	batching and process all files in a single batch. If the -z flag is
	specified, the -b flag is ignored and all files are processed in a
	single batch.

	The following command verifies all revisions of all archive files:

		p4 verify -qz //...

	Saved digests are used by 'p4 diff' rather than recomputing them.

	The -S flag verifies shelved files. If -S is specified, the only
	valid revision specifier is @=change, specifying a single shelf.
	In a distributed installation, 'verify -S' should be run on the
	Edge Server where the shelf was created. If the shelf has been
	promoted, 'verify -S' may also be run on the Commit Server.

	The -U flag verifies files in the unload depot (see 'p4 help unload').

	The -A flag verifies files in the archive depot (see
	'p4 help archive').
	
	The -R flag provides a repair mode to help with disaster recovery.
	If an archive file is missing, this mode will check if an identical
	file is shelved, the matching archive is then copied.

	NOTE: Task stream files require special handling when using the
	verify command. You must pay attention to whether you are running
	the command with a client switched to that task stream or not. If
	the verify command is run without using a client bound to that task
	stream, it will only verify the promoted task stream files, while if
	a task stream client is used, the command will verify all the task
	stream files. When using 'verify -v' to rewrite the digest or size
	information for a task stream file, run the command twice: first run
	the command with a non-task-stream client, then re-run the command
	with a client bound to the task stream. This process allows the
	server to process the database data in the correct order.

	'p4 verify' requires that the user be an operator or have 'admin'
	 access, which is granted by 'p4 protect'.

	output will match none of the exclude patterns.

	The -F filter flag limits output to records that match the filter
	pattern.  The filter pattern uses the same syntax as the -F filter
	flag on the 'p4 fstat' command.  Filtering is case-sensitive.

	        Example: -F "table = db.protect"

	The -T flag specifies a list of database tables that are excluded
	from the exported output.  To specify multiple tables, double-quote
	the list and separate the table names with spaces. The table names
	must start with "db.". Table names can also be separated by commas.

	Note: to delimit transactions and indicate the end of the journal,
	additional fields are added to the tagged output.

	Note: The final record is a position record that specifies the
	position where subsequent records are located.  When processing a
	checkpoint, a position can be either a continuation of the checkpoint
	position (if the line count option was supplied) or a journal number.
	When processing a journal, if the last record processed is the last
	record the server has written, an 'atend' tag is inserted.  This
	tag indicates to a polling process that it must wait for more data

	'p4 pull' instructs this replica server to retrieve either journal
	records or file contents from its target server.

	The -i flag causes the command to automatically repeat its action
	every N seconds. If -i is not specified, the command runs once,
	then exits.

	The -b flag specifies a wait time before retrying a pull after
	a failed pull attempt.  This defaults to 60 seconds.

	The -u flag causes the command to retrieve file content. If -u is
	not specified, the command retrieves journal records and applies
	them to this server. Multiple 'p4 pull -u' commands may be active
	on a single replica server.

	The -l flag displays information about pending file content
	transfers. If -s is also specified, only a summary is displayed.
	If -j is instead specified, a summary of pending journal transfers
	is displayed. When the -v flag is added the current lag is displayed
	regardless of the value of the rpl.track.behind configurable. See
	'p4 help configurables' for more information.

	The -d flag specifies that the pending file content transfer should
	be cancelled. You must also specify the filename and revision using
	the -f and -r flags. Note that this is not the normal Helix Core file
	and revision data, but rather the archive file and revision. The
	correct archive filename and revision information to provide can be
	viewed using 'pull -l'. The 'pull -d' command can be useful when a
	file transfer is failing due to unrecoverable errors on the master.

	Without -u, -l, -R, -t, or -d, pull retrieves journal records.

	For the pull command which retrieves journal records, you may specify
	-i 0, which causes the pull thread to use an alternate scheduling
	algorithm that can reduce replica lag at the cost of slightly higher
	resource use on the target server.

	The -J prefix flag can be used when pulling journal records or when
	listing pending journal transfers to specify a file name prefix to
	match the one used with p4d -jc prefix.

	The -P flag controls replica data filtering. Typically, filtering is
	defined in the server spec (see 'p4 help server'), and the replica's
	journal pull thread specifies the replica's serverid to enable the
	filtering. It is also possible to specify 'p4 export' filter patterns
	using the -P flag, although this is an unusual configuration style.
	See 'p4 help export' for information about filter patterns.

	The -T flag specifies a list of database tables that are excluded
	from the journal records.  To specify multiple tables, double-quote
	the list and separate the table names with spaces. The table names
	must start with "db.". Table names can also be separated by commas.

	The -L flag specifies that journal records shall be retrieved from a
	local journal file, such as is produced by 'p4 journalcopy'. The
	'pull -L' and 'journalcopy' commands are designed to be used together
	in a standby replica (see 'p4 help replication').

	The --batch flag specifies the number of files a pull thread should
	process in a single request. The default is 1 and is usually
	adequate. For high-latency configurations, a larger value may
	improve archive transfer speed for large numbers of small files.

	The --min-size and --max-size options (which must be used with -u
	and --batch) can be used to create different pull threads for files
	with different sizes. Pull threads called with these options will
	only pull a file if its data size falls within the specified data
	size range. The size unit is bytes, but K, M, G, and T modifiers
	can also be used (i.e. 2K, etc).

	The --trigger option is used with a pull-archive trigger to transfer
	files using an alternative file transfer mechanism from within the
	trigger. This option is only used in a distributed environment and
	is not supported for RCS storage. The configurable pull.trigger.dir
	must be set to a location to write temporary files. It is also
	recommended to set lbr.replica.notransfer=1 to suppress 'on demand'
	file transfer.

	The -R flag can be used to retry failed archive file transfers.
	While the -d option may be used to remove pending or failed file
	transfers individually, this option will instead reset the retry
	count of failed transfers so that subsequent pull operations can
	retry the transfers.

	The -t option supports background and parallel archive transfer.
	If any pull threads get "stuck", issue this command
	manually on the commit server to pull the stuck threads.

	This command requires 'super' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

	A server specification describes the high-level configuration
	and usage of a server. For installations with only a single server,
	the server specification is optional; server specifications are
	necessary when your installation expands to include features such
	as: replication, proxying, disaster recovery, etc.

	For additional help on replication, see 'p4 help replication'.

	The 'server' command puts the server spec into a temporary file and
	invokes the editor configured by the environment variable $P4EDITOR.
	Saving the file creates or modifies the server spec.

	The server spec contains the following fields:

	ServerID:  The server identifier.

	Type:      The server executable type.
	           One of: server(p4d), proxy(p4p), broker(p4broker),
	           or connector(p4gconn)

	    %'mandatory'%      A %'standby'% or %'forwarding-standby'% server
	                   that persists %'journalcopy'ed'% metadata before
	                   that metadata is replicated to other replicas.
	                   A %'standby'% or %'forwarding-standby'% server with
	                   this option set can be used for failover
	                   whether or not the server from which it
	                   is %'journalcopy'ing'% is available at the
	                   time of the failover.
	    %'nomandatory'% *  Replication to other replicas can occur
	                   before the metadata has been persisted by
	                   this %'standby'% or %'forwarding-standby'% server.
	                   Failover can occur to this %'standby'% or
	                   %'forwarding-standby'% server only if the
	                   server from which it is %'journalcopy'ing'%
	                   is available at the time of the failover.

	%'ReplicatingFrom'%:
	           Server ID of the server from which this server is
	           replicating or %'journalcopy'ing'%. This field is required
	           when the server is a %'standby'% or %'forwarding-standby'%
	           server.

	Name:      The P4NAME that is used by the server (optional).

	Address:   The P4PORT that is used by the server (optional).

	ExternalAddress:
	           For an edge server, this optional field can contain its
	           external address for connections from the commit server.
	           This field is required for distributed parallel submit.

	UpdateCachedRepos:
	           For a git-connector, this optional field contains a
	           list of graph repos which will be updated from Helix
	           by 'gconn poll-repos', typically called by a cron process.

	Description:
	           A description of the server (optional).

	User:      The service user that is used by the server (optional).

	AllowedAddresses:
	           A list of addresses that are valid this server.  At security
	           level 6 this field is used to associate intermediary
	           servers with specified service users. Connections through
	           intermediary servers without matching server specs will be
	           blocked.

	ClientDataFilter:
	           For a replica server, this optional field can contain one
	           or more patterns describing how active client data is to
	           be filtered. Active client data includes have lists,
	           working records, and pending resolves.

	           Each pattern, in client syntax with optional wildcards,
	           should specify whether the data is to be included or
	           excluded, using the syntax:
	               //client-pattern/...   -- client data to include
	               -//client-pattern/...  -- client data to exclude

	RevisionDataFilter:
	           For a replica server, this optional field can contain one
	           or more patterns describing how submitted revision data is
	           to be filtered. Submitted revision data includes revision
	           records, integration records, label contents, and the
	           files listed in submitted changelists.

	           Each pattern, in depot syntax with optional wildcards,
	           should specify whether the data is to be included or
	           excluded, using the syntax:
	               //depot/pattern/...   -- include this depot path
	               -//depot/pattern/...  -- exclude this depot path

	ArchiveDataFilter:
	           For a replica server, this optional field can contain one
	           or more patterns describing the policy for automatically
	           scheduling the replication of file content. If this field
	           is present, only those files described by the pattern are
	           automatically transferred to the replica; other files will
	           not be transferred until they are referenced by a replica
	           command which needs the file content.

	DistributedConfig:
	           This optional field shows configuration settings relevant
	           to this server. When invoked with the -c flag, the
	           configuration values are populated with currently
	           configured values, recommended default values if unset,
	           or 'unset' for unset values with no default. If this
	           field is present when invoked with -c, the configuration
	           commands in this field are run on the current server
	           using the scope of the ServerID server.

	The -g flag generates a new server UUID.

	The -d flag deletes the named server spec.

	The -o flag writes the server spec to standard output. The user's
	editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a server spec to be read from the standard input.
	The user's editor is not invoked. This option may be combined with
	the -c flag to generate and run configuration variables used to set
	up an edge or commit server in a distributed environment. When used
	with -c, only the fields explicitly set in standard input from
	the DistributedConfig field will be configured.

	The -c <services> option allows the user to set, change or display
	configuration values used to set up the distributed environment
	on an edge or commit server by using the DistributedConfig field.
	Configuration fields are initially populated using configured
	values if set, default values for recommended configuration
	values if they are unset, or 'unset' for recommended configuration
	values that have no default. After exiting from the form, any
	configuration commands in the DistributedConfig	field will be run
	on the current server for the scope of the serverID. Note that the
	commands only apply to the serverID server, and so the 'server#'
	prefix is not allowed in these commands. The only supported
	services are edge-server and commit-server. The service dictates
	which configuration values are used to initially populate the form
	the first time that the server command is run.

    servers -- Display list of server specifications

    p4 servers [-J | --replication-status]

	Lists server specifications. (See 'p4 help server'.)

	The -J (or --replication-status) flag instead reports information
	about this server's journal, and about the replication status of all
	replicas that replicate from this server (if any).  The fields shown
	are the server id, last updated time, server type, persisted journal
	position, applied journal position, flags, is-alive, and the %'mandatory'%
	option (if set). The is-alive field is 0 for a replica that is not
	running, or 1 for a live replica.  The persisted and applied journal
	fields are different only for a replica running journalcopy: the
	persisted position is the last journal offset that this replica
	has persisted to disk and acknowledged to the master server, and
	the applied position is the offset of the last journal record that
	has been applied to the replica's database.

	The first row displays information about this server, and the following
	rows display information about each replica that has either requested
	journal records from this server or has this server's ID as the value
	for the %'ReplicatingFrom'% field in it's server definition.  Only
	replicas that have a serverID or a P4NAME are listed in the results.

	The flags are a set of fields, each printed in upper-case if it is set
	or in lower-case if it is not; the numeric value of the flags is
	displayed after the alphabetic display.  Each field is listed below
	with its value, name, and description:

    p4 storage -w
    p4 storage -U [-q] [-n threads] archive...
    p4 storage -l start|pause|restart|wait|status|cancel //depotdirectory/...

	The first form of this command displays information about the server
	archive files and their usage.

	The fields that storage displays are:
		lbrFile            -- the path of the archive file
		lbrRev             -- the revision of the archive file
		lbrType            -- the file type the archive file,
		                      e.g. text+C
		lbrRefCount        -- how many revs refer to the archive file
		headTime           -- timestamp of when the record was written
		fileSize           -- size of the archive file
		digest             -- MD5 digest of the archive file
		serverSize         -- Size of the archive file on the server
		                      at the time that revision was submitted
		                      or shelved
		compCksum          -- MD5 of the archive file containing the
		                      revision on the server if the file is
		                      compressed and submit.storagefields is 1

	Additional fields when the -v flag is specified:
		actualSize         -- actual size of revision computed from
		                      archive file
		actualDigest       -- actual MD5 digest of revision computed
		                      from archive file
		status             -- outcome of verify, OK, BAD or MISSING


	The -v flag verifies that the specified archive files are intact.
	'p4 storage -v' computes and displays the digest of each archive.
	If an archive cannot be reproduced (for example, if the file is
	missing from the archive), the archive's output line ends with
	MISSING!  If there is a saved digest, 'p4 storage' compares it with
	the computed one. If they differ, the output line ends with BAD!

	The -u flag computes and saves the digest only for revisions that
	have no saved digest.

	The -q flag minimises the output of the 'storage -v' command,
	displaying only errors from mismatched digests or unreproducible
	revisions.

	The -d flag deletes unreferenced archives. If the specified archive
	has a reference count of 0 and the age of the storage record is
	greater than the expiry time, then the record describing the
	archive is removed and the underlying archive revision, if present,
	is deleted from the file system. Without the -y confirm, the command
	just lists the candidate revisions it would remove. With the
	-y flag the revisions and zero referenced storage records are
	removed. The expiry time is set by the tunable variable called
	"lbr.storage.delay". It has a default value of 86400 seconds (one day).
	This expiry value can be overridden on the command line by specifying
	the '-D secs' parameter. Archives with a reference count of 0
	are rare, but can be created by incomplete 'p4 submit' or 'p4 shelve'
	commands, system crashes, other similar errors or
	'p4 storage -l start'. The listing of the candidate revisions can be
	suppressed by giving the -q option. The -t target option requests that
	rather than deleting the unreferenced archives, the revisions are first
	copied to the specified 'target' directory and then deleted.

	The -F flag lists only records satisfying the filter expression. This
	filter syntax is similar to the one used for 'jobs -e jobview' and is
	used to evaluate the contents of the fields in the preceding list.
	Filtering is case-sensitive.

	        Example: -v -F "lbrRefCount = 1 & status=OK"

	The -T fields flag returns only the specified fields. The field names
	can be specified using a comma- or space-delimited list.

	        Example: -T "lbrFile, lbrRev"

	The -c changelist# flag displays records associated with the specified
	changelist.

	The -m max flag limits output to the specified number of records.

	The -w flag detects if the second phase of a storage upgrade
	is in progress. The command returns with the message
	"The storage upgrade process is complete." only once the
	storage upgrade is finished.

	The -U flag reads all the storage records looking for an unset
	digest field. When it detects an unset digest it recomputes
	the digest and size fields and updates the record. This is
	intended to be used after a storage upgrade has been performed
	with lbr.storage.skipkeyed set to avoid the delay incurred by
	calculating the digest during the upgrade. The -q flag can be
	supplied with the -U flag and this suppresses the progress
	messages produced. The -n threads flag specifies the number of
	threads to use. 0 = no threads; n = use n threads. When the n
	flags is not specified, the command uses the lbr.storage.threads
	configuration variable. The -U flag requires 'super' access.

	The -l flag controls a background process that scans the server root
	looking for orphaned files that are no longer referenced by the server,
	and makes a note of them so they can be removed using the -d flag.
	The background scanning process looks for files in the specified
	//depotdirectory and its sub directories that match the naming
	convention for the server's archive file format. Each file
	that is found along with its revision is checked for a matching entry
	in the db.storage table. If no such entry is found, then a new record
	is created that describes the file/revision combination with a
	reference count of 0. A later call to 'p4 storage -d' will locate these
	zero reference counted records and remove them along with the archive
	revision. This provides a two stage process to detect orphaned files
	and remove them.

	Subcommand options:
	    start  -  start a new background depot scanning task starting in
	              the specified //depotdirectory and scan it and all its
	              sub directories. The special //depotdirectory argument of
	              '//...' is handled by searching for all the local depots
	              listed in the depot table and scanning their top and
	              sub directories. There is no limit on the number of
	              background processes that can be started, subject to the
	              constraints of the hardware and operating system limits.
	              Each directory in the archive may only be the subject of
	              a single scan. An unfinished scan is automatically
	              marked as paused when the server is shutdown.
	    pause   - suspend the named background scan process.
	    restart - resume the named paused background scan process.
	    wait    - wait until the named background scan process completes or
	              fails due to an error.
	    status  - report on the named background scan process, or all the
	              background scan processes if the special argument of
	              '//...' is specified.
	              For each scan the following fields are displayed:
	              scanName  - the name of the scan, the argument passed to
	                          the 'start' subcommand;
	              state     - one of 'done', 'paused', 'run', 'busy' or
	                          'error';
	              dirsProc  - the number of directories that have been
	                          processed;
	              filesProc - the number of files that have been processed;
	              zeroRecs  - the number of zero referenced storage records
	                          created. This is the number of orphan
	                          revisions that have no matching storage
	                          record;
	              dirsErrs  - the number of directories skipped due to
	                          errors;
	              errmsg    - if the state is 'error', then this is the
	                          error message that caused the failure;
	    cancel  - remove the scan from the system. A scan remains in
	              the system until it is cancelled. This is true even
	              if the scan state is 'done' or 'error'. You must
	              pause an active scan before you can cancel it;

	Warning. Scanning requires that each file can only be addressed by
	         a single path under the scanning directory. This
	         requirement can easily be broken by the presence of
	         symlinks. Therefore by default the scanner will halt
	         with an error if it detects a symlink. Symlinks can
	         be allowed by setting the lbr.storage.allowsymlink
	         tunable to 1. This should only be done if all the
	         symlinks only reference files and directories that
	         are not under any scanned directory.
	         The scanner will also not run if the depot is being shared
	         between servers.

    A replica is a server which has a copy of another server's data.

    Common reasons for setting up a replica server include: offloading work
    from the main server, and providing better performance for users in
    remote locations.

    There are different types of replica servers, such as read-only
    replicas, forwarding replicas, Edge Servers, etc. See 'p4 help server'
    for more details about server types and features. The process of
    adding a new replica server to an existing installation involves:
    preparing a machine with adequate system resources, configuring the
    new server, and initializing the new server from a copy of the target
    server's data and archives. Once the replica server is operational,
    it should be monitored routinely to ensure that any error conditions
    are detected and resolved.

    Replica data filtering is configured by specifying filter patterns in
    the replica's server spec and specifying the replica's serverid in the
    -P flag on the 'p4 pull' command to enable the filtering.

    A distributed installation contains a Commit Server and one or more Edge
    Servers. See 'p4 help distributed' for more information.

    Replica servers support a variety of approaches to handling the depot
    archives, selected by the lbr.replication configurable setting:

	none:              Replica has no access to depot archives. Commands
	                   which reference file content will be rejected.

	readonly:          Replica will maintain a readonly copy of the
	                   target server's archives. New files are copied by
	                   'pull -u' threads and purged files are removed.
	                   Commands which reference file content are allowed,
	                   and the file will be retrieved from the target if
	                   it is missing from the replica.

	shared, or         Replica allows commands which reference file
	ondemand:          content, but does not automatically transfer new
	(synonyms)         files nor remove purged files. If a file is not
	                   present in the archives, commands which reference
	                   that file will fail. Important: This mode MUST
	                   be used when a replica directly shares the same
	                   physical archives as its P4TARGET (whether by
	                   running on the same machine or via a network
	                   share), and the replica's P4TARGET MUST be a commit
	                   or master server. This mode can also be used when
	                   an external archive synchronization technique such
	                   as 'rsync' is used for archives.

	cache:             Replica allows commands which reference file
	                   content, but does not automatically transfer new
	                   files. Files which are purged from the target are
	                   removed from the replica when the purge operation
	                   is replicated. If a file is not present in the
	                   archives, the replica will retrieve it from the
	                   target server.

    Edge servers have the additional ability to write shelved files to their
    own depot archive, except when lbr.replication=none.

    Automatic retrieval of new file content can be further controlled by the
    ArchiveDataFilter setting in the 'p4 server' spec.

    Connections made via forwarding replicas and Edge Servers may require
    special handling in the protections table if the Host: field specifies
    an IP address; see 'p4 help protect' for more information.

    A standby replica processes journal records from its master server in
    such a way that it can be used for failover if the master server dies.
    A standby replica uses both the 'journalcopy' and 'pull -L' commands
    together to ensure that the replica journals exactly match the master.

    Complete information about replica configuration and operation can be
    found in the Helix Core Server Administrator Guide: Multi-Site
    Deployment.

	A server of type 'build-server' (see 'p4 help server') is a replica
	which supports build farm integration.

	A build-server replica supports the same read-only commands that a
	simple replica supports. In addition, the 'p4 client' command may be
	used to create or edit client workspaces on a build-server.

	Such workspaces may issue the 'p4 sync' command, in addition to all
	read-only commands supported by the replica. The 'p4 sync' command on
	a bound workspace is processed entirely by the build-server replica,
	which entirely relieves the master server of all computation, file
	transfer, networking, and database update resource usage for those
	sync commands.

	The build-server replica records view-mapping and have-list metadata
	in its local database, using the separate db.view.rp and db.have.rp
	database tables. Domain information for bound workspaces is recorded
	in the db.domain table, which is global to all servers in the
	installation. A workspace which is bound to a build-server must still
	have a globally-unique name; this is enforced by the 'p4 client'
	command on the build-server.

	When creating or editing a client workspace for a build-server,
	the client specified by the optional 'name' argument, as well as the

    A distributed installation contains a Commit Server and one or more Edge
    Servers. Individual client workspaces are bound to the Edge Server on
    which they are created, and all work in progress for those workspaces
    resides only on their owning Edge Server.

    An Edge Server supports the full Helix Core command set; however, there
    are a few differences in behavior which may affect applications.

    A pending change can be viewed on an Edge Server other than the one
    where the change was created. In that case, the pending change will not
    display a list of open files; the open files are shown only on the
    owning server. A pending changelist can be updated or deleted only on
    the server where the change was created.

    Files of type +l are handled specially in a distributed installation.
    When +l filetypes are opened, the Edge Server contacts the Commit Server
    to ensure that the file is not locked on another Edge Server.

    By default, labels are also bound to the Edge Server on which they are
    created; the -g flag indicates that the label is to be defined globally
    on all servers in the installation. Configuring rpl.labels.global=1
    reverses this default and causes the flag to have the opposite meaning.

    When moving your workspace from one server to another, using 'sync -k'
    and 'reconcile' makes it easy to migrate without needing to reload your
    work. An alternate mechanism is to unload your workspace on the old
    server and use 'reload -p' to reload it onto the new server. In either
    case, shelves created by the workspace remain on the server where they
    were created. The unload/reload mechanism can also be used to move a
    locally-bound label from one Edge Server to another.

    A spec depot on an Edge Server contains all the contents of the spec
    depot on the Commit Server. Additionally, the Edge Server spec depot
    contains entries for clients and labels bound to that Edge Server.
    Consider using a Typemap definition such as text+CS4 for client and
    label spec depot entries, or using a SpecMap field on the spec depot
    definition to ensure that the Edge Server spec depot does not grow
    excessively large.

    An unload depot on an Edge Server contains all the contents of the
    unload depot on the Commit Server. Additionally, the Edge Server unload
    depot contains entries for clients and labels that were unloaded on
    that edge server.

    Shelved files behave differently in a distributed configuration. A
    shelf is accessible only on the Edge Server where it was created, unless
    it is promoted (see the discussion of the 'shelve' command below).

    When backing up your Edge Server(s), ensure that you checkpoint all
    database tables and retain rotated journals between checkpoints.
    Also, ensure that you back up any shelved file content, unloaded clients
    and labels, and spec depot entries for clients and labels that have been
    created on this Edge Server, as that data is local to this Edge Server
    and not contained in the backups of your Commit Server.

    Most commonly-used commands are executed directly on this Edge Server
    and are unaffected by resource constraints on other servers in your
    installation. However, there are certain performance implications of a
    distributed installation that you should anticipate:
    - Files using the RCS storage format undergo multiple file format
      conversions during submit. Use text+C or text+F storage formats instead
      to avoid this penalty.
    - The submit command is slower than in a non-distributed installation,
      since the changelist must be copied from the Edge Server to the Commit
      Server during submit processing. If you are creating a new branch, use
      the populate command instead to avoid this overhead.
    - Updates to workspace and label definitions, requests for new change
      numbers, and opening or reverting +l files require messages to be sent
      to the Commit server.
    - Background 'pull' threads in the Edge Server may contend for resources
      with commands run by Edge Server users.

    Notable differences in command behavior in a distributed installation:

    changes -s shelved file...:
        Searching for shelves affecting particular files can be done only
        on the Edge Server where the shelf was created, or on the Commit
        Server if the shelf was promoted.

    client, clients -a -s:
        A client workspace is bound to its Edge Server when it is created,
        and may not be used on other Edge Servers. The 'p4 clients' command
        displays only those clients bound to this Edge Server; use the -a
        flag to display the complete list of clients, or the -s serverID
        flag to display the list of clients bound to a specific Edge Server.

    describe, change
        The files associated with a pending change are visible only on the
        Edge Server where the change was created.

    label, labels -a -s:
        A label is present only on the Edge Server where it was created.
        The 'p4 labels' command displays only those labels bound to this
        Edge Server; use the -a flag to display the complete list of labels,
        or the -s serverID flag to display labels of a specific Edge Server.
        Labels created on the Commit Server are global, and are visible on
        all servers in the distributed installation.

    label -g, labelsync -g, tag -g:
        The -g flag specifies that the label, labelsync, or tag command should
        execute on the Commit Server to create or update a globally-visible
        label; otherwise the label is present only on this Edge Server.

    labels file[revrange]:
        When a file specification is provided, the 'p4 labels' command
        displays the matching labels, but only shows labels bound to this
        Edge Server. The file specification argument is not allowed if the
        -a or -s flags are provided.

    lock, unlock:
        The lock and unlock commands only prevent submissions from other
        clients on this Edge Server.

    logger:
        In a distributed installation, 'p4 logger' commands should be issued
        to the Commit Server, not to an Edge Server.

    obliterate:
        The obliterate command removes submitted revision data from the
        Commit Server, and also removes any related client data for clients
        resident on the Commit Server. When the file removal operations are
        replicated to an Edge Server, that Edge Server automatically reverts
        any open changes to those files for clients resident on that Edge
        Server. Edge Server clients may still list the obliterated file(s)
        in the output of 'p4 have'; the file(s) will be removed from their
        have list the next time that client issues a 'p4 sync'.

    opened -a:
        Displays only those files opened by other workspaces on this Edge
        Server; files opened on other Edge Servers do not appear.

    opened -x:
        Displays information about exclusively locked files.

    reload -p:
        Allows an unloaded client or label to be reloaded on a different
        server. Note that any shelves which were created by the client
        remain on the server where they were created.

    shelve, unshelve:
        A shelf is present only on the Edge Server where it is created, and
        can only be unshelved by workspaces on that Edge Server. A shelf can
        be promoted by specifying the '-p' flag; this causes the shelf data
        to be redundantly stored on the Commit Server as well as on this
        Edge Server. A promoted shelf is accessible by users on other Edge
        Servers, although there is a performance penalty as the shelf data
        must be retrieved on demand when it is referenced. Although it is
        accessible from other Edge Servers, the shelf can only be submitted
        from the Edge Server on which it was created. On an Edge Server
        which is running with lbr.replication=shared, all new shelves
        are automatically promoted without needing '-p'. If a workspace
        has promoted shelves, those shelves must be deleted prior to
        deleting, unloading, or migrating that workspace to another server.

    spec depot:
        The spec depot may have different contents on each Edge Server.
        Clients and labels bound to an Edge Server are recorded in the
        spec depot on that Edge Server only. The 'depot -d' command for the
        spec depot does not verify that the Edge Server spec depots are empty.

    triggers:
        The submit command on the Edge Server will run the 'edge-submit'
        and 'edge-content' triggers, if defined, prior to transferring
        the changelist to the Commit Server for final submission. The submit
        command on the Commit Server will run the standard trigger types;
        however, if the change was submitted from an Edge Server, the
        'change' and 'describe' commands must not be used in the trigger.
        The %%serverid%% variable in the trigger command should be used for
        trigger definitions which need to detect which server is running
        the trigger.

    unload depot:
        The unload depot may have different contents on each Edge Server.
        Clients and labels bound to an Edge Server are unloaded into the
        unload depot on that Edge Server. Specify the -s or -a flag to the
        'p4 clients -U' and 'p4 labels -U' commands on the Edge Server to
        view unloaded clients or labels for another Edge Server.

        Be sure to include the unload depot as part of your Edge Server
        backups. Since the Commit Server does not verify that the unload
        depot is empty on every Edge Server, you must specify 'depot -d -f'
        in order to delete the unload depot from the Commit Server.

    unlock -x:
        Releases exclusive locks which have become orphaned due to network
        outages between the Edge Server and the Commit Server.

    unsubmit, resubmit:
        These commands are not available on an Edge Server.

    user -i -f:
        Automatic creation of new user specs is disabled on Edge Servers.
        To create a new user, the administrator should run 'p4 user -f'.

    archive, attribute -f, labelsync -g, obliterate, populate, restore,
    retype, snap, tag -g:
        When one of these commands is issued to an Edge Server, the command
        is forwarded to the Commit Server for processing. In this case,
        specify any arguments to the command using depot syntax, not client
        syntax nor local syntax. In order to use client or local syntax for
        these commands, you must issue the command directly to the Commit
        Server (and use a workspace bound to the Commit Server).

	A replica used as a standby spare or for disaster recovery will
	maintain a complete copy of the master server's versioned file
	archives. Replicas which are used for other purposes may not need
	to hold a copy of the content of every version of every file.

	The cachepurge command is useful for replicas with limited disk space
	resources. Depending on the scenario, a replica may not need to
	retain a copy of all of the versioned file archives of its master. If
	the replica is not being used for disaster recovery purposes, you can
	reclaim disk space by periodically deleting versioned files from the
	replica. Note: This is only safe to do if you are certain that you
	have a backup of these files, either a backup made on this replica or
	on another replica or on a backup made on the master server.

	The disk space goal is specified using one of the required flags:
	-a, -f, -m, or -s.

	Each time the cachepurge command runs, it attempts to permanently
	delete enough file content from the replica to achieve the goal
	specified by parameters to the command. Note that the file content
	is only deleted from this replica, not from the master server or any
	other replica, and also note that if a command is issued to this
	replica which accesses the file content in the future, the file will
	be re-retrieved from the master.

	The -a flag specifies to delete all file content. This reclaims the
	maximum amount of disk space, but also means any file content must
	be re-retrieved from the master.

	The -f flag specifies a free space target for the filesystem in bytes.
	When used regularly, this will cause the replica to maintain that
	amount of free disk space on the depot filesystem.

	The -m flag specifies the number of file revisions to delete. This
	may free up more or less space, depending on the size of the files.

	The -s flag specifies the number of bytes of file data to delete.
	This can be helpful for replicas which have a predictable observed
	growth rate in their filesystem resources.

	The -i flag causes the command to automatically repeat its action
	every N seconds. If -i is not specified, the command runs once,
	then exits.

	The -n flag displays a preview of the cachepurge operation without
	deleting any files.

	The cachepurge command normally examines all files in the repository.
	The -D flag may be used to specify the subset of the files that are
	to be eligible for purging.

	The cachepurge command normally chooses files to delete at random.
	The -R flag inhibits this random behavior, and causes files to be
	deleted in order. The -a flag implies the -R flag.

	The -S flag specifies that the N most recent revisions of each file
	are not to be removed. Specifying -S 1 therefore ensures that the
	head revision of each file is retained in the replica's cache if it
	is already present there.

	The -O flag specifies that the files are to be ordered from oldest to
	newest, in order to prefer the deletion of older content over newer.
	The -O flag requires that the -R flag also be specified.

	For best results, this command should not be used if the new user has

    p4 push [-n -r remotespec -v -O flags] [-S stream | filespec]
    p4 push [-n -r remotespec -v -O flags] -s shelf

	The push command takes the specified set of files, and the
	changelists which submitted those files, and copies them to
	the specified target server.

	A push is only allowed if the files being pushed fit cleanly into
	the target server, building precisely on a shared common history.
	If there are any conflicts or gaps, the push is rejected.
	Otherwise, the changelists become new submitted changelists
	in the target server.

	The second form of the command pushes a shelved changelist, rather
	than one or more submitted changelists, in which case conflicts do
	not arise; the result is a new shelved change in the target server.

	When the changelists are added to the target server, they
	are given newly assigned change numbers but they retain the
	same description, user, date, type, workspace, and set of files.

	When the files are added to the target server, they are kept
	in their same changelists, as new revisions starting after the
	current head. The new revisions retain the same revision number,
	file type, action, date, timestamp, digest, and file size.

	Although the changelists are new submitted changelists in the
	target server, none of the submit triggers are run in the
	target server. Instead, use the push-* triggers for that purpose.

	The push command can also be used to copy a shelf to the target
	server by specifying the -s flag.

	Typically, the push command specifies a remote spec, and the
	DepotMap field in the remote spec specifies which files are to be
	pushed. The push command may also specify an argument to further
	restrict the files to be pushed.

	The restriction argument may be either the name of a stream
	(e.g., '-S dev'), or it may be a filename pattern (e.g.,
	//stream/dev/...). You may not specify both types of restrictions
	in a single push command.

	If a stream name or filespec is provided, and the remote spec uses
	differing patterns for the local and remote sides of the DepotMap,
	the stream name or filespec argument must specify the files using the
	local filename syntax.

	If a particular changelist includes some files that match the
	restriction, and other files that do not, then only the matching
	files are included in the push. Note that if a remote spec is also
	provided, only the files that match the restriction and are mapped by
	the remote spec are included in the push.

	In addition to the file revisions and the changelists, the push
	command also copies the archive content to the target server.
	In the case of lazy copies, the target server may already have the
	corresponding archive, in which case the lazy copy is adjusted
	to reference the target server's existing archives.

	The push command also copies all integration records which
	describe integrations to the files being pushed. These integration
	records are adjusted in the target server to reflect the resulting
	changelist numbers and revision numbers of the target server.
	Integration records are copied only if the integration source is
	mapped by the remote spec specified for the push.

	The push command also copies all attributes which have been set on
	the files being pushed using 'p4 attribute', and copies all fixes
	which have been attached to the changelists being pushed, providing
	the jobs mentioned by those fixes exist in the destination server.

	In order to push a set of files, you must have read access to those
	files in the current repository, and you must have write access to
	those same files in the target repository (according to the target
	repository's protections table); your local userid is also used as
	the userid at the target server and you must already be logged in
	to both servers prior to running the push command.

	The push command is atomic: either all the specified files
	are pushed, or none of them are pushed.

	By default, changes cannot be pushed from server to server; in order
	to push changes between servers, an administrator of each server must
	enable pushing. Set server.allowpush=1 on the server which initiates
	the push; set server.allowpush=2 on the destination server.

	Files with the filetype modifier +S have some special considerations.
	When pushing files of type +S, old archives which exceed the
	specified limit are not purged by the push command.

	If a push command fails, it will leave those files locked on the
	remote server. 'p4 opened' will display '*locked*', and the files
	cannot be submitted by any other user. If the push command cannot be
	quickly retried, you can use the 'p4 unlock -r' commmand to unlock
	the files on the remote server. By default, the files in a failed
	push operation are left locked. To change that behavior, set the
	push.unlocklocked configurable which unlocks the files upon a
	push failure.

	The push command is not allowed if there are unsubmitted changes in
	this server; use 'p4 resubmit' to resubmit those changes first, or
	discard the shelves with 'p4 shelve -d' if they are not wanted.

	The -r flag specifies a remote spec which contains the address of
	the target server, and a file mapping which is to be used to re-map
	the files when they are pushed to the target server. If -r is not
	specified, the default is -r origin. See also 'p4 help remote'.

	The --remote-user flag may be used to specify the username for the
	target server, overriding any RemoteUser field in the remote spec.

	The --preserve-change-numbers flag may be used to preserve the
	pushed change numbers on the target server. Push will fail
	if there are any conflicting changelist numbers.

	The -S flag specifies a stream name to restrict the files to be
	included in the push.

	The -n flag performs all the correctness checks, but does not
	push any files or changelists to the target server.

	The -s flag specifies a shelved changelist to be copied, instead
	of copying one or more submitted changelists.

	The -v flag specifies verbose mode.

	The -O flag controls the output verbose mode, and has the format
	'-Ocfi'. If 'c' is specified, verbose mode includes information about

	See 'p4 help resubmit' for information about the 'p4 resubmit'
	command, which is useful for resubmitting unsubmitted changelists
	in a controlled process.

	revRange is a revision or a revision range that limits the span of
	file history to be unsubmitted.

	If the file argument has a revision, the specified revision is
	unsubmitted.  If the file argument has a revision range, the
	revisions in that range are unsubmitted.  See 'p4 help revisions'
	for help.

	In all of these cases, all changes which affect any of the specified
	revision(s) of any of the specified file(s) will be unsubmitted.

	The changelist must have been submitted by the same user and
	workspace which are used in the unsubmit command.

	The files in the changelist must be the head revisions of those
	files in the repository. The files must not have been integrated
	into any other files in the repository. The files must not be open
	by any pending or shelved changelists. The files must not have been
	archived or purged. The files must not have associated attributes.

	If the command specifies multiple files and/or multiple revisions,
	all the changelists which affected the specified revisions of the
	specified files are unsubmitted; each such change becomes its own
	separate shelf.

	Fix records associated with the changelist are not modified. After
	unsubmitting a change which has associated jobs, you should review
	the job and fix status for accuracy.

	The shelved changelists that are created do not fire any triggers
	of type shelve-submit or shelve-commit.

	The -n flag performs all the correctness checks, but does not

	The 'remote' command puts the remote spec into a temporary file and
	invokes the editor configured by the environment variable $P4EDITOR.
	Saving the file creates or modifies the remote spec.

	Remote specs are used by the fetch, push, and clone commands. For

	For the clone command, the specified remote spec must be present on
	the server being cloned; the clone command copies the remote spec
	to the new personal repository and renames the spec to 'origin'.

	The remote spec contains the following fields:

	depot syntax in order to map the remote server's files into a
	alternate location in the local server. The left side of the map
	specifies the local server location; the right side of the map
	specifies the remote server location.

	Any mapping of depot files may be specified in a remote spec, and
	will be used by the fetch and push commands to guide their operation.
	The clone command has certain restrictions on the DepotMap field,
	which are described in the next paragraph.

	The clone command interprets the remote spec and uses it to guide
	the setup of the new personal repository. The left side of the map
	is used to determine the depot and stream(s) that will be created.
	The left side of the map must only specify mappings for a single
	depot, but the right side of the map may have locations in multiple
	depots of the server being cloned. The left side of the map may
	specify one or more stream names in the new personal repository. The
	stream name is the second level in the path name on the left side.
	The left side must specify at least one stream, or clone will fail.
	If multiple streams are specified on the left side of the map, each
	stream will be created by the clone command as a separate mainline,
	and the last stream in the map will be the current stream after the

    p4 fetch [-r remotespec -v -O flags -n] -s shelf

	The fetch command copies the specified set of files, and the
	changelists which submitted those files, into this server from
	the specified remote server.

	A fetch is only allowed if the files being fetched fit cleanly into
	this server, building precisely on a shared common history.
	If there are no conflicts, the files and their changelists become
	new submitted changelists in this server.

	The second form of the command copies a shelved changelist, rather
	than one or more submitted changelists, in which case conflicts do
	not arise; the result is a new shelved change in the target server.

	Conflict handling is enabled using the -t flag. If no conflict
	handling was specified, and there are any conflicts or gaps,
	the fetch is rejected.

	After handling the conflicting changes, the remote work is then
	fetched. After the fetch completes, use 'p4 resubmit' to resubmit
	the conflicting local changes.

	When the changelists are added to this server, they
	are given newly assigned change numbers but they retain the
	same description, user, date, type, workspace, and set of files.

	When the files are added to this server, they are kept
	in their same changelists, as new revisions starting after the
	current head. The new revisions retain the same revision number,
	file type, action, date, timestamp, digest, and file size.

	Although the changelists are new submitted changelists in this
	server, none of the submit triggers are run in this server.

	Typically, the fetch command specifies a remote spec, and the
	DepotMap field in the remote spec specifies which files are to be
	fetched. The fetch command may also specify an argument to further
	restrict the files to be fetched.

	The restriction argument may be either the name of a stream
	(e.g., '-S dev'), or it may be a filename pattern (e.g.,
	//stream/dev/...). You may not specify both types of restrictions
	in a single fetch command.

	If a stream name or filespec is provided, and the remote spec uses
	differing patterns for the local and remote sides of the DepotMap,
	the stream name or filespec argument must specify the files using the
	local server's depot syntax. Note that the filespec must always be
	provided using depot syntax, not client syntax nor filesystem syntax.

	If a particular changelist includes some files that match the
	restriction, and other files that do not, then only the matching
	files are included in the fetch. Note that if a remote spec is also
	provided, only the files that match the restriction and are mapped by
	the remote spec are included in the fetch.

	In addition to the file revisions and the changelists, the fetch
	command also copies the archive content to this server.
	In the case of lazy copies, this server may already have the
	corresponding archive, in which case the lazy copy is adjusted
	to reference this server's existing archives.

	The fetch command also copies all integration records which
	describe integrations to the files being fetched. These integration
	records are adjusted in this server to reflect the resulting
	changelist numbers and revision numbers of this server.
	Integration records are copied only if the integration source is
	mapped by the remote spec specified for the fetch.

	The fetch command also copies all attributes which have been set on
	the files being fetched using 'p4 attribute', and copies all fixes
	which have been attached to the changelists being fetched, providing
	the jobs mentioned by those fixes exist in the destination server.

	In order to fetch a set of files, you must have read access to those
	files in the remote repository, and you must have write access to
	those same files in this repository; your local userid is used as
	the userid at the target server and you must already be logged in
	to both servers prior to running the fetch command.

	By default, changes cannot be fetched from server to server; in order
	to fetch changes from another server, an administrator of each server
	must enable fetching. Set server.allowfetch=1 on the server which
	initiates the fetch; set server.allowfetch=2 on the remote server.

	The fetch command is atomic: either all the specified files
	are fetched, or none of them are fetched.

	Files with the filetype modifier +S have some special considerations.
	When fetching files of type +S, old archives which exceed the
	specified limit are not purged by the fetch command.

	The -r flag specifies a remote spec which contains the address of
	the target server, and a file mapping which is to be used to re-map
	the files when they are fetched from the target server. If -r is not
	specified, the default is -r origin. See also 'p4 help remote'.

	The --remote-user flag may be used to specify the username for the
	target server, overriding any RemoteUser field in the remote spec.

	The --preserve-change-numbers flag may be used to preserve the
	change numbers of the fetched changelists on this server. Fetch
	will fail if there are any conflicting changelist numbers.

	The -m flag specifies to perform a shallow fetch; only the last N
	revisions of each file are fetched.

	The -n flag performs all the correctness checks, but does not
	fetch any files or changelists from the target server.

	The -s flag specifies a shelved changelist to be fetched, instead
	of fetching one or more submitted changelists.

	The -S flag specifies a stream name to restrict the files to be
	included in the fetch.

	The -t flag specifies that conflicting changes should be moved to
	a new tangent, as described earlier. The -t flag requires the -r
	flag. The -t flag also requires that an administrator has set
	server.allowrewrite=1. In order to use the -t flag, you must have
	admin access to the files to be fetched.

	The -k flag specifies that the fetch command should not sync files.
	Normally, after fetching new work, the fetch command automatically
	syncs your workspace to the head revision. The -k flag prevents that
	automatic sync operation.

	The -v flag specifies verbose mode.

	The -O flag controls the output verbose mode, and has the format
	'-Ocfi'. If 'c' is specified, verbose mode includes information about
	each changelist; if 'f' is specified, verbose mode includes
	information about each file; if 'i' is specified, verbose mode

    Helix Core can be used as either a centralized version control system,
    or as a decentralized version control system, or as a blend of both
    approaches, to accomplish the following:

    - You can create a personal server that you can use to manage
      versioned content all by yourself, without interacting with
      any other Helix Core Server unless you want to.

    - You can copy work between Helix Core Servers to implement
      various collaboration workflows.

    - You can rewrite and revise history to discard unwanted
      intermediate information.

    Use the 'p4 init' command to create a new personal repository,
    or use the 'p4 clone' command to create one with files from an
    existing server.  Use the 'p4 switch' command to create new
    streams, and to switch back and forth between existing streams.

    Use the 'p4 fetch' and 'p4 push' commands to copy work back and
    forth between servers, either peer-to-peer or in a hub-and-spoke
    or hierarchical arrangement. The work that is copied is typically
    one or more submitted changelists, but can also be a shelved change.
    Pushing a shelved change can accomodate various code review workflows.

    Use the 'p4 remote' and 'p4 remotes' commands to manage connections
    to multiple partner repositories.

    Use the 'p4 unsubmit' and 'p4 resubmit' commands to rewrite and
    revise history prior to pushing that work to other servers.

    The new fetch, push, and unsubmit functionality is disabled by
    default. To enable the new functionality, set the 'server.allowpush',
    'server.allowfetch', and/or 'server.allowrewrite' configurables
    to enable the desired level of operation.

    The 'p4 zip' and 'p4 unzip' commands enable the equivalent of fetching
    and pushing files in scenarios where a simple authenticated network
    connection between the two servers cannot be established.

    Files of type +l can be cooperatively locked across servers. The
    shared server must be configured as a Commit Server, and must also
    set server.allowremoteLocking=1. Then individual personal servers
    can use the --remote flag on 'p4 edit' to manage exclusive file locks
    on the Commit Server; these locks are released when the files are
    pushed. See 'p4 help edit', 'p4 help push', and 'p4 help unlock'.

	no stream switch is performed, but the workspace is synced to that
	change.

	will be populated with the files from the specified stream, rather
	than the files from the current stream.
	Local (dvcs) server only command.

	The -l flag specifies that all known streams should be listed.

	The -L flag specifies that all streams that were switched @change
	with files open in that stream should be listed.

	The -r flag reopens files in the new mapped location of the specified
	stream. If you omit the -r flag, and you have opened files in the
	current stream, those files are shelved before switching to the new
	stream, and are unshelved subsequently when you switch back to this
	stream.

	The -R option changes the way 'reconcile' is run when switching
	between streams:

	        -Ra     reconcile files not currently under Helix Core control,
	                (these files are opened for add).

	        -Rd     reconcile files that have been removed,
	                (these files are opened for delete).
	        -Rn     reconcile does not run.

	        Without this option, 'reconcile' runs as if all (-Raed)
	        options were set.

	The --no-sync flag prevents sync of file content for unopened files.

	The -v flag gives verbose information.

	With no arguments, the switch command displays the current stream.

	When switching to a different stream, the switch command first runs
	'p4 reconcile' to determine which files have been modified in the
	current stream.

	You cannot switch to a new stream if files are open in a numbered
	changelist. If files are open in the default changelist, they will
	be shelved and reverted prior to switching to the new stream, and
	will be automatically unshelved when switching back to this stream.

	After switching to the new stream, switch syncs your workspace to
	the head of the new stream, and unshelves any files which were open
	in the default changelist the last time you used that stream.

	The resubmit command resubmits changes which have been unsubmitted.

	The resubmit command is typically used in one of two scenarios:
	- to resolve conflicting changes which were detected and
	  unsubmitted by running 'p4 fetch -t'.
	- to revise a set of changelists that you have submitted locally,
	  but have not pushed to any other server, and have unsubmitted.

	If the -l flag is specified, resubmit lists all the unsubmitted
	changes but takes no action. This is useful as a way to preview
	the work that must be resubmitted.

	There are three modes in which resubmit may run:
	- automatic
	- partially interactive
	- fully interactive

	If the -m flag is specified, resubmit runs in automatic mode. The
	first thing resubmit -m does is to sync your workspace to #head.
	Then, resubmit -m processes each conflicting change, doing the
	following for each change:
	- sync
	- integrate tangent/...@=change dest/...
	- resolve -am
	- submit

	If, for any change in the list, the 'resolve -am' processing detects
	merge conflicts in any file in that change, the resubmit command
	terminates at that point. All the files in that change which had
	merge conflicts are left unresolved. You must then run the resolve
	command to resolve the conflicts. Then run 'resubmit -R -m' to
	resume the resubmit process.

	For all three resubmit modes, you can use the -R flag to resume the
	resubmit process once conflicts have been resolved. This flag causes
	resubmit to begin by submitting that fully-resolved change, after
	which it will proceed to the next unsubmitted change.

	The -e flag runs resubmit in partially-interactive mode.
	The -e flag allows you to resolve each change, build and run tests,
	examine differences, etc., prior to submitting it,
	while the -i flag is a fully-interactive resubmission tool.

	If the -e flag is specified, resubmit prepares the first (oldest)
	conflicting change, then exits. The files for the change are open
	in your workspace, but not resolved. You must then resolve the
	merges, reopen and modify already-resolved merges, or make any other
	necessary changes. You can additionally build and test the changes,
	inspect them, etc. When you are satisfied with this change, run
	'resubmit -R -e' to submit it and prepare the next conflicting change.

	If the -i flag is specified, resubmit runs in fully interactive mode.

	If a file path is also specified, interactive resubmit first
	unsubmits each change that modified a file in that path. If the -r
	flag is additionally specified, it names a remote spec. The mapping
	in the remote spec is then used to limit the files affected by the
	unsubmit operation. Thus a command such as 'p4 resubmit -r rmt @>=17'
	will affect only the files specified by the remote spec, not all
	files in the depot.

	Resubmit -i then processes each conflicting change. For each change,
	resubmit displays summary information about the change, then
	offers the following prompts:

	c		Modify the change description for this change
	m		Merge this change, then submit if no conflicts
	e		Merge this change, then exit for further editing
	r		Interactively resolve this change, then
	                submit if no conflicts
	a		Add (squash) this change into the next conflicting
	                change
	s		Skip this change and move on to the next
	d		Delete this change without submitting it
	b		Begin again from the earliest remaining change
	l		List the changes remaining to be processed
	v		View the current change in short form
	V		View the current change with full diffs
	R		Display the status of resolved and unresolved merges
	q		Quit the resubmit operation
	?		Display (short) help during the resubmit command.

	After choosing either 'e' or 'q', you can subsequently continue
	interactive resubmit by running 'resubmit -R -i'.

	The interactive resubmit command is very flexible: you can reorder
	changes, combine changes, discard changes, etc.

	When multiple changes are resubmitted by the resubmit command, the
	command will automatically switch to the correct stream at the start
	of resubmitting each change. This means that, when the command
	completes, your current stream may have been switched. You should
	then run 'p4 switch' and 'p4 switch -l' if necessary, and switch
	back to the desired stream before resuming your work.

	The SubmitOptions flags in the client spec have no effect on the
	changelists that are submitted by 'p4 resubmit'; this command always
	operates in 'submitunchanged' mode.

	The resubmit command is not available on an Edge Server.

	'p4 rebase' is an alias for 'p4 resubmit'.

    aliases -- Display the list of aliases from the P4ALIASES file.

    p4 aliases

	The aliases file can be used to define command line aliases.

	When using the p4 command line tool, each command you enter is
	transformed by any alias definitions in your aliases file prior
	to being sent to the server for execution.

	Typical uses of aliases include: abbreviating complex commands;
	displaying command results in alternate output formats; automating
	simple multi-command sequences; and providing alternate syntax
	for commands you find hard to remember.

	The name of the aliases file is ~/.p4aliases on non-Windows platforms
	and %%USERPROFILE%%\p4aliases.txt on Windows platforms; this
	can be overridden using the P4ALIASES environment variable.

	Your aliases file can contain as many aliases as you want, in any
	order, specified one per line in the format:

	    alias = transformation

	Your aliases file can also contain comments: if the first non-blank
	character on a line is '#', the entire line is treated as a comment.

	When you issue a command which matches one of your aliases, the
	command is automatically modified by applying the transformation
	before issuing the command.

	Alias matching is case-sensitive even on otherwise case-insensitive
	platforms.

	The transformation can be a simple replacement:

	    commit = submit
	    halt = admin shutdown

	Certain characters in an alias definition have special meaning:
	    =      : separates the alias and its transformation
	    $(var) : denotes a named variable
	    &&     : separates two commands in a multi-command alias
	    >      : directs the output of a command to a variable
	    <      : directs the input of a command from a variable
	    \      : indicates the transformation continues on the next line

	The transformation can thus be more complex, and result in multiple
	commands issued to the server:

	    show-status = monitor show && lockstat && changes -m 1

	The transformation can include parameter substitutions:

	    myChanges = changes -u $(P4USER)

	The parameters can be arguments to the alias:

	    my-recent-changes $(max) = changes -u $(P4USER) -m $(max)

	The special built-in variables $(EQ), $(LT), and $(GT) expand
	to =, <, and >, respectively.

	Complex aliases are possible, and often involve using the output
	of one command as input to another:

	    show-last-change=-F "%%change%%" -ztag changes -m 1 \
	                         -s submitted > $(chg) &&
	                     describe -s $(chg)

	    reopenCL $(cl) = -F "%%depotFile%%" -ztag files @$(EQ)$(cl) \
	                         > $(files) && \

    - The git data model tracks the history of entire repositories. The

    resolve -- Resolve integrations and updates to repo workspace files

    p4 resolve [options] [file ...]

	options: [-a<flags> -n]

	'p4 resolve' resolves changes to files in the client workspace.

	'p4 resolve' works only on files that have been scheduled to be
	resolved.  The commands that can schedule resolves are: 'p4 sync',
	'p4 update', 'p4 submit', 'p4 merge', and 'p4 integrate'.  Files must
	be resolved before they can be submitted.

	Resolving involves two sets of files, a source and a target.  The
	target is a set of depot files that maps to opened files in the
	client workspace.  When resolving an integration, the source is a
	different set of depot files than the target.  When resolving an
	update, the source is the same set of depot files as the target,
	at a different revision.

	The 'p4 resolve' file argument specifies the target.  If the file
	argument is omitted, all unresolved files are resolved.

	Resolving can modify workspace files.

	The resolve process is a classic three-way merge. The participating
	files are referred to as follows:

	  'yours'       The target file open in the client workspace
	  'theirs'      The source file in the depot
	  'base'        The common ancestor; the highest revision of the
	                source file already accounted for in the target.
	  'merged'      The merged result.

	Filenames, filetypes, and text file content can be resolved by
	accepting 'yours', 'theirs', or 'merged'.  Branching, deletion, and
	binary file content can be resolved by accepting either 'yours' or
	'theirs'.

	When resolving integrated changes, 'p4 resolve' distinguishes among
	four results: entirely yours, entirely theirs, a pure merge, or an
	edited merge.  The distinction is recorded when resolved files are
	submitted, and will be used by future commands to determine whether
	integration is needed.

	In all cases, accepting 'yours' leaves the target file in its current
	state.  The result of accepting 'theirs' is as follows:

	   Content:     The target file content is overwritten.
	   Attribute:   The target's attributes are replaced.
 	   Deletion:    The target file is deleted.
 	   Filename:	The target file is moved or renamed.
 	   Filetype:    The target file's type is changed.

	For each unresolved change, the user is prompted to accept a result.
	Content and non-content changes are resolved separately.  For content,
	'p4 resolve' places the merged result into a temporary file in the
	client workspace.  If there are any conflicts, the merged file contains
	conflict markers that must be removed by the user.

	'p4 resolve' displays a count of text diffs and conflicts, and offers
	the following prompts:

	  Accept:
	     at              Keep only changes to their file.
	     ay              Keep only changes to your file.

	The -am flag causes the workspace file to be replaced with the result
	of merging theirs with yours. If the merge detected conflicts, the
	file is left untouched and unresolved.

	file in the client workspace.

	The -ay flag resolves all files by accepting yours and ignoring
	theirs. It preserves the content of workspace files.

	The -n flag previews the operation without altering files.

    MFA - Multi Factor Authentication.

	Support for multi factor authentication (formally referred to as
	second factor authentication or 2FA) is provided by installing three
	triggers of the types auth-pre-2fa, auth-init-2fa and auth-check-2fa
	(only one of each may be defined and all three must be present).
	These triggers are expected to return JSON results to the server.
	Once installed, and the server has been restarted, the security level
	will be implicitly set to 3 (it can be explicitly set higher).

	To configure a user to require multi factor authentication, the
	AuthMethod field in their user spec must be modified to either
	"perforce+2fa" or "ldap+2fa". This will require them to run
	"p4 login2" to perform the multi authentication steps (if automatic
	login prompting is enabled, users will automatically perform this
	after their normal password based authentication. See "p4 help login2".

	There are three phases to multi factor authentication, each based on
	the execution of that phase's trigger:

	1. list-methods

	    This phase presents the user with a list of available multi factor
	    authentication methods. For example, they may be configured to use
	    either SMS or a mobile authentication application.
	    In interactive mode, if the user only has one method, this is
	    chosen automatically. These methods are returned by the
	    "auth-pre-2fa" trigger. The trigger may also indicate that the
	    user doesn't require multi authentication in this instance, or
	    that they are not permitted access at all.

	    This trigger is expected to return 0 on success and return a JSON
	    string to the server via STDOUT. The JSON response should be in the
	    following format:

	        {
	          "status" : 0,
	          "methodlist" : [
	            [ "method1" , "method description1" ],
	            [ "method2" , "method description2" ]
	          ],
	          "message" : "Error message"
	        }

	    The status field is required, and should be 0 on success with the
	    methodlist populated: a dictionary of authentication where the
	    key is the method name and the value is the method description.
	    If the status is set to 2, this indicates that the multi factor
	    authentication is not required for this user on this host at this
	    time. Any other status value is considered to be a rejection of the
	    authentication attempt. In these cases the methodlist is not needed
	    and instead a message may be provided to be relayed to the user.
	    For example:

	        {
	          "status" : 2,
	          "message" : "Multi factor authentication not required"
	        }

	2. init-auth

	    This phase begins the multi authentication flow for the chosen
	    method. It calls the "auth-init-2fa" trigger, returning at
	    minimum the status (0 for success) and the scheme. In the case
	    of an error, the status would be non-zero and the scheme is not
	    required. A message may be reported to the user in either case.
	    An optional challenge may be set to be presented to the user. For
	    authentication flows that require state between init and check, a
	    token may be set: this is stored in the server but never reported
	    to the user: it is available to the next trigger via a trigger
	    variable. Here is an example JSON response:

	        {
	          "status" : 0,
	          "scheme" : "challenge",
	          "message" : "Please enter your response",
	          "challenge" : "ABBACD",
	          "token" : "REQID:20003339189"
	        }

	    There are 4 possible values for scheme:
	        otp-generated - A One-Time-Password generated by a user device.
	        otp-requested - A One-Time-Password sent to the user.
	        challenge     - A challenge/response based on a token displayed
	                        to the user
	        external      - A request to a 3rd-party prompting method, like
	                        an app based push notification.

	3. check-auth

	    This phases performs the verification step for the authentication
	    flow initialized by init-auth. If the scheme is "external", the
	    "auth-2fa-check" trigger is called to query the status of the
	    prompt from the authentication provider. Otherwise the user is
	    prompted for their One-Time-Password or challenge response, which
	    is passed to the "auth-2fa-check" trigger via STDIN and is
	    validated against the multi factor authentication provider. The
	    response of this trigger is represented in JSON as a status field
	    and an option message to the user. The status values are 0 for
	    success and non-zero for failure (authentication rejected). If the
	    scheme is "external", then it is possible that the authentication
	    provider might still be waiting for the user's response; returning
	    a status value of 2 will instruct the server to neither accept or
	    reject the authentication attempt. For example:

	        {
	          "status" : 2,
	          "message" : "A token was sent to your phone"
	        }

	All three trigger's specific variables are:

	    %%user%%     - the user's username
	    %%fullname%% - the user's fullname
	    %%email%%    - the user's email address
	    %%host%%     - the user's host's IP address
	    %%method%%   - the authentication method from list-methods
	                 (may be set to "unknown")
	    %%scheme%%   - the authentication schemed set by init-auth
	                 (may be set to "unknown")
	    %%token%%    - the stashed token from the last init-auth
	                 (may be empty)

	    Given that the %%fullname%% and %%email%% fields are populated from
	    fields in the user spec which are modifiable by default, if these
	    are used it is advisable to set dm.user.allowselfupdate=0. This
	    will prevent users modifying those fields.

	Helix Core Server System Resource Monitoring

	The Helix Core Server has the ability to monitor the availability
	of various operating system resources, and reduce the amount of
	work it accepts if resource availability is running thin.  This
	prevents over-subscription of resources, and helps maintain more
	consistent performance.

	The target use-case for resource monitoring is to prevent large
	spikes of resource usage.  The server will even out the spike,
	spreading the load over a larger period of time.

	Servers with a high number of concurrently-running commands will
	benefit the most from this.  Configuring server monitoring such that
	its thresholds are above the day-to-day ceiling of load is suggested,
	as it will result in the least amount of performance change from
	the baseline.  Setting the thresholds too low will result in resource
	under-utilization and unnecessary slowdowns.

	The resources available for monitoring are CPU pressure and memory
	usage.  Resource monitoring interfaces in operating systems are
	not consistent, so not all resources can be monitored in the same
	way everywhere.

	Resource usage is categorized as being in a low/medium/high (0/1/2)
	state.

	When any resource is heading to or past its configured threshold, the
	server begins pausing incoming commands until resource usage has
	dropped below the threshold.  The paused state is entered after the
	client-server connection has been established, but before the
	requested command has begun executing.  The time a command is able to
	spend in the paused state is controlled by the
	'sys.pressure.max.pause.time' configurable.  Setting this configurable
	to zero disables pausing commands entirely.  The total number of
	commands the server will maintain in the paused state is controlled by
	the 'sys.pressure.max.paused' configurable.  A variety of
	administrative and replication commands are not subject to pausing and
	may run at any resource pressure level.

	When resource monitoring is enabled and running, 'p4 -ztag info' will
	supply a non-zero timestamp for the 'resourcePressureLastUpdate'
	field, representing the last time resource status was sampled.  When
	the server is under resource pressure, the 'resourcePressure.*'
	fields will show the rate at which commands are being paused at.

	When command monitoring is enabled, paused commands are visible with
	'p4 monitor show -s P' (the 'paused' monitor status).  The time spent
	in the paused state is recorded in the tracking entries of server
	P4LOG files and the command-end records of structured logs.

	Client commands that request progress output from the server (e.g.
	'p4 -I $command') will receive a 'command paused' message while their
	commands are being paused.  No other feedback is sent to the client
	while paused.

	Extensions may register a single 'pressure-pause' hook, which will be
	called periodically while a command going to be paused - the Extension
	can choose to pause, unpause, or defer the choice to the server - this
	can be used to implement site-specific throttling policy, picking and
	choosing which commands must wait while the OS is under pressure.

	The following configurables are available to customize server
	resource-monitoring behavior:

	    # Maximum number of seconds an individual command may wait while
	    # paused before giving up and returning an error to the client.
	    sys.pressure.max.pause.time

	    # Maximum number of concurrently-paused client commands on the
	    # server.  New incoming commands above this threshold will be
	    # rejected with an error.
	    sys.pressure.max.paused

	    # Percentage-based memory thresholds, ranged 0-100, and is the
	    # ratio of total system memory vs memory available to use without
	    # swapping.
	    sys.pressure.mem.high
	    sys.pressure.mem.medium

	    # OS-supplied resource pressure thresholds, ranged 0-100, defined
	    # as the percentage of processes on the system stalled for the
	    # resource.
	    sys.pressure.os.cpu.high
	    sys.pressure.os.mem.high
	    sys.pressure.os.mem.medium

	    # Window size for averaging samples of resource pressure.  The
	    # larger the window, the less sensitive/responsive the server
	    # will be to changes in pressure.  These values are milliseconds.
	    sys.pressure.mem.high.duration
	    sys.pressure.mem.medium.duration
	    sys.pressure.os.cpu.high.duration
	    sys.pressure.os.mem.high.duration
	    sys.pressure.os.mem.medium.duration

	The 'medium' and 'high' thresholds must not be the same, and the 'high'
	threshold must be greater than 'medium'.  When changing their settings,
	their default values will be used if these invariants are broken.

	There are two options for configuring memory pressure monitoring.  The
	first is percentage-based, which is calculated with the amount
	of memory available to use without swapping, and the total of system
	amount memory, in percent.  The second uses OS-supplied memory pressure
	data, which (if the OS supports it), gives the server a more accurate
	view of system status.  Both options may be configured together or
	separately.  Disable either or both by setting their 'high'
	configurable to zero.  The two options are complimentary, but serve
	distinct use-cases.  Percentage-based data is best used on servers
	that have a large enough buffer of free memory such that normal
	load does not reach high levels.  Percentage-based configuration is
	also how a site could reserve enough memory for the OS to maintain
	a filesystem cache.  The OS-supplied pressure option is targeted
	as the backstop that prevents application load from overrunning the
	capacity of the OS/hardware, leading to system/application instability
	and is suitable for any size of Helix Core Server installation.

	The 'sys.pressure.*.mem.medium' and 'sys.pressure.*.mem.high'
	configurables mark the relevant thresholds for memory monitoring.
	The 'medium' level specifies where the server will try to keep memory
	usage below.  The 'high' level is intended to be set below where the
	operating system is about to thrash into swap or become unstable (such
	as having processes subject to the OOM killer). New incoming commands
	received by the server while at the 'high' threshold will be rejected
	outright.  Existing commands that request more memory while the server
	is above the 'high' threshold may be canceled and return an error to
	the client.  Note that the server does not distinguish between memory
	used by other processes on the operating system and its own when
	limiting its work - e.g. if a large external process comes and consumes
	a lot of memory, the Helix Core Server can throttle itself in response.

	The OS-supplied memory pressure option is available on all Windows
	versions, and on Linux with cgroup v2.  For Linux, the
	'sys.pressure.os.mem.high' configurable represents the amount of time
	some processes on the system are spending stalled waiting for the
	memory.  See the Linux kernel's definition of
	'Pressure Stall Information' (PSI) for further details.  Note that on
	Windows, only the 'high' pressure state (low memory) is reported by
	the OS, so 'sys.pressure.os.mem.medium' is not available.

	CPU monitoring is only available on Linux platforms with cgroups v2
	support configured.  The 'sys.pressure.os.cpu.high' configurable
	represents the amount of time some processes on the system are spending
	stalled waiting for CPU time.

	For Linux cgroup support, only the system-wide '/proc/pressure/*' files
	are considered.

	Administrators are encouraged to consider their usage patterns and
	hardware configuration and to evaluate non-default settings.
	Setting the group 'MaxMemory' limit for all commands such that the
	upper limit is never too high is a good idea, so the distance between
	the medium memory threshhold and the high level has some multiple of
	the biggest possible command's memory.  Memory checking within each
	command as it is processing is also done at periodic intervals, so
	the distance between the 'high' threshold and the real out-of-memory
	zone for the operating system ought to have some room to accommodate
	allocations between checks.

	The prerequisites for the server to be able to respond to resource
	pressure are:

	    0) Operating system support

	    1) Realtime monitoring counters enabled.

	    2) The 'p4 admin resource-monitor' server startup command
	       running (see 'p4 help admin-resource-monitor').

	    3) Existing resource usage baselines have been established.

	    4) Tweak pressure-related configurables to above-baseline values.

	    5) Enough space between the baseline usage and the medium/high
	       thresholds such that the command-pausing is not always on.

	E.g.:

	    p4 serverid $name
	    p4 configure set rt.monitorfile=$monitor_file
	    p4 configure set "$name#startup.1=admin resource-monitor"
	    p4 admin restart

	It is recommended that prior to enabling the full resource monitoring
	configuration, that it be run in preview-mode for a while in order to
	gauge the effect of the configured thresholds.  Preview-mode is when
	the feature is configured, but 'sys.pressure.max.pause.time=0' - i.e.
	the 'p4 admin resource-monitor' background task is sampling resources,
	setting pressure levels, but commands are not subject to pausing.

	To disable monitoring, there are a few options:

	    0) Turn off the 'p4 admin resource-monitor' startup
	       command, either with 'p4 monitor terminate', or by removing the
	       startup configurable and restarting the server.

	    1) Change the 'sys.pressure.max.pause.time' configurable to zero.

	    2) Change the values of the configurable thresholds
	       (sys.pressure...high) to zero.  Either resource type may be
	       disabled independently.

	To further protect the Helix Core Server from the effects of low
	system resources, on Linux, the server can be configured to coordinate
	with the system OOM killer (Out Of Memory), effectively shielding the
	Helix Core Server from being killed when the operating system kernel
	is running out of memory.  The Helix Core Server, when configured, will
	change its OOM score during database writes, and restore it to the
	default when done writing in order to protect its database integrity.

	To enable OOM protection, the "sys resource" system capability must be
	granted the the Helix Core Server executable ('p4d'), e.g. via:

	    sudo setcap 'CAP_SYS_RESOURCE=+ep' p4d

	The default score of -1000 effectively makes it impossible to kill the
	server during low memory conditions.  It's possible to disable or
	change the likelyhood of the OOM killer targeting a database writer via
	the 'server.oom_adj_score' configurable.  A value of zero means 'off',
	and increasing values between -1000 and 0 correspond to increasing
	likelyhood of OOM kills.

	To verify that the server is able to perform an OS-specific
	resource-related task (i.e. the configuration is correct), look for
	a server startup log message about capabilities, e.g. via:

	    p4d -p localhost:$tmp_port -r $tmp_p4root -L -

    diagnostics -- generate server diagnostics

    p4 diagnostics [-L limit]
    p4 diagnostics [-l] [-s] [-a [-L limit] ]

	The first form of the command generates the basic
	diagnostic data and downloads it to a number of fixed named
	files in the current directory. These files are:
	diags - basic configuration details, configuration,
	        configuration history, server setting,
	        and checkpoint history;
	monitor - the monitor records, if monitoring is enabled;
	topology - a textual description of network that contains
	           this server;

	A copy of the current journal file and log file will also be
	downloaded, using the configured names of these files.

	The '-L' limit option limits the download size
	of the journal and log files to the last 'limit' number of bytes
	of these files subject to buffer rounding. The 'limit' option is
	in bytes and can be suffixed with a single character to designate
	a unit multiplier, k or K for kilobytes, m or M for megabytes,
	g or G for gigabytes and t or T for terabytes.

	The second form of the command attempts to run more costly
	operations so these are not run by default.

	The '-l' option requests that the '/usr/bin/lsof' be run
	to provide locking details of all files in use by Perforce
	servers on this system. The data from this operation is
	downloaded into a file named 'manuallocks' in the current
	directory. This option is not supported on all platforms.

	The '-s' option runs an 'strace' command on the server
	processes for 20 seconds and downloads the trace output to a
	file named 'strace' in the current directory.

	When the '-l' or '-s' options are specified, then the
	basic diagnostic files are not produced. These can be requested
	by adding the '-a' option to the command.

	This command requires the operator role or 'admin' permission.

    p4d -0
	When the Helix Core Server is registered as a Zeroconf service, the
	service-type is 'p4', which is visible in DNS Service browse mode
	Discovery as '_p4._tcp'.  If mDNS is not available on the host,
	service registration fails and logs an error in the server log,

	The -0 (digit zero) flag enables Zeroconf registry at server start time,
	overriding any value set for the $P4ZEROCONF environment variable.
	When using the environment variable, the presence of the variable
	in the environment enables the service registry.

	    The following identity flags can be used to configure Zeroconf
	    registry settings:

	    p4d -In name
		Specifies a unique name for your server.  This name is
		displayed in 'p4 -ztag info' output and by DNS Service
		Discovery, if you register the process as a Zeroconf service.
		This flag overrides any value set for the $P4NAME environment
		variable.  If the name includes spaces, double-quote it.
		A valid name must contain at least one non-numeric character.

	    p4d -Id description
		Specifies a description of your server. This description is
		displayed in 'p4 -ztag info' output and by DNS Service
		Discovery, if you register the process as a Zeroconf service.
		This flag overrides any value set for the $P4DESCRIPTION
		environment variable.  If the description includes spaces,
